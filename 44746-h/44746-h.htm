<div class="epigraph">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Blessed are the people of whom history is
silent; for history occupies itself more with the doings of fools than
of the wise; with storms than with tranquil days: it immortalizes the
butcher and the tyrant, and consigns to oblivion the innocent and
peaceful.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="sc">Cibrario.</span></p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Something of the deep, strong attachment to their
native mountains which is innate in the children of the Alps steals
over me when I think of my pleasant journeyings in Tirol<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e418src" href="#xd21e418" name=
"xd21e418src">1</a>.</p>
<p>Though it is a little, out-of-the-way country whose cry is seldom
heard in the newspapers, though it exercises little influence in
political complications, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2"
name="pb2">2</a>]</span>the character of its people is one which, next
after that of our own, has a claim to our esteem and admiration. Hardy,
patient, and persevering; patriotic and loyal to a fault; honest and
hospitable to a proverb&mdash;they carry the observance of their
religion into the minutest practice of every-day life; and there
underlies all these more solid qualities a tender, poetical, romantic
spirit which throws a soft halo round their ceaseless toil, and invests
their heroic struggles for independence with a bright glow of
chivalry.</p>
<p>Surrounded from their earliest years with living pictures of
Nature&rsquo;s choicest forms and colouring, they need no popular
fiction to cultivate their imagination, no schools of design to educate
their taste.</p>
<p>Shut out from the world&rsquo;s ambitions by their pathless Alps,
they have learned to see before them two aims alone,&mdash;to maintain
the integrity and the sanctity of their humble homes on earth, and to
obtain one day a place in that better Home above, to which the uplifted
fingers of their sun-bathed mountain-peaks ever gloriously point.</p>
<p>The paramount claims on their hearts&rsquo; allegiance of the hearth
and the altar are inseparably interwoven in their social code, and
their creed scarcely knows of a distinction between Nature and
Nature&rsquo;s God.</p>
<p>At their mother&rsquo;s knee they have learnt, every <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>one, to
prattle of their Father in heaven with as complete a realization of His
existence as of that of their father on earth. Just as they receive
their toil-won food and raiment as an earnest of the paternal care of
the one, the change of the seasons, the sunshine and the rain, betoken
to them as certainly that of the Other. They scarcely trace any line of
demarcation between the natural and the supernatural; and earth and sky
are not for them the veil which hides Divinity, but the very temple and
shrine of the Godhead dwelling among His creatures.</p>
<p>Going forth in this simple faith through the pure, unfogged
atmosphere which surrounds them, it is scarce to be wondered at if they
can trace the guiding footprints and the unerring hand of Providence
where for others are only chances and coincidences. Or that&mdash;like
the faint outline of wished-for land revealing itself to the trained
eye of the sailor, where the landsman sees but a hopeless expanse of
sky and ocean&mdash;they should recognize a personal will and
individuality in the powers which are the messengers to them of the
good pleasure of Heaven, in the germination of fruit and grain, in the
multiplication of their flocks and herds; or of the envious malice of
the Evil One, in the wind and the lightning, the torrent and the
avalanche, destroying the work of their hands.</p>
<p>It is necessary to bear this well in mind, or we <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>shall not
appreciate the delights which their fantastic tales have in store for
us. We must learn to realize that this way of viewing things has
created a nomenclature, almost a language, of its own.</p>
<p>When the boisterous blast sweeps through their valleys, scattering
the scent of the wild game, and driving them far out of their reach,
they say it is the <i lang="de">Wilder J&auml;ger</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd21e446src" href="#xd21e446" name="xd21e446src">2</a>, the
<i>Beatr&igrave;k</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e451src" href=
"#xd21e451" name="xd21e451src">3</a>, or the <i lang=
"de">Nachtvolk</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e462src" href="#xd21e462"
name="xd21e462src">4</a>, on his chase. Their restless energies, pent
up within the shelter of their rattling walls and casements, invest him
with a retinue of pitiless followers and fiery-eyed hounds&mdash;while
the fate of some who have ventured out while he is said to be abroad,
blown over precipices or lost in crevasses, is expressed by the fancy
that his train is closed by a number of empty pairs of shoes, which run
away with those who come within his influence.</p>
<p>When the bright beams of sun and moon enliven their landscape, or
fructify their seed, or guide their midnight way, they fable of them as
beautiful maidens with all sorts of fanciful names derived from
associations as old as the world: <i>Perahta</i>, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>brightness,
daughter of <i>Dagha</i>, the daylight&mdash;hence, also, Perchtl and
Berchtl. In other localities, <i>Holda</i> or <i>Hulda</i>; in others
again, they are known as <i lang="de">Angane</i>, and <i lang=
"de">Enguane</i>, the <i lang="de">Saligen Fra&uuml;elein</i>, <i lang=
"de">Nornen</i>, <i lang="de">Zarger Fra&uuml;elein</i>, and <i lang=
"de">Weissen Fra&uuml;elein</i>. They say they smile on the
overburdened peasant, beguile his labour by singing to him, show him
visions of beautiful landscapes, bestow wonderful gifts&mdash;loaves
which never diminish, bowls and skittles, charcoal and corn of pure
gold; to the husbandman they give counsels in his farming; to the good
housewife an unfailing store&mdash;bobbins of linen thread which all
her weaving never exhausts; they help the youth or the maiden to obtain
the return of the love they have longed for, and have some succour in
store for every weary soul.</p>
<p>Such helpers the people recognize of the masculine gender, also, in
the so-called <i lang="de">N&ouml;rgl</i>, <i lang="de">Pechmannl</i>,
<i lang="de">P&uuml;tzl</i>, <i lang="de">Wiehtm&auml;nnlein</i>,
<i lang="de">K&auml;serm&auml;nnlein</i>, and <i>Salvanel</i>; for
possibly, they say, not all the angels who rebelled with Lucifer may
have been cast into the outer darkness. There may have been some not so
evilly disposed themselves, but talked over and led astray by others;
and such, arrested in their descent by a merciful reprieve, may have
been only banished to the desolate and stony places of the earth, to
tops of barren mountains and fruitless trees. Such as these might be
expected to entertain a friendly feeling for the human beings who
inhabit the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>regions which gave them shelter, and to be ready to
do them a good turn when it lay in their way&mdash;lift weights, and
carry burdens for them up the steep heights, and protect their wild
game. And, also, it is not inconsistent with their nature to love to
play them a mischievous trick full oft&mdash;make off with the
provision of loaves prepared for the mowers; sit, while remaining
invisible, on their sledges and increase their difficulty and confusion
in crossing the mountain-paths lost in snow; entice them into the woods
with beseeching voices, and then leave them to wander in perplexity;
overturn the farm-maids&rsquo; creaming-pans; roll the
<i>Senner&rsquo;s</i> cheeses down the mountain sides.</p>
<p>Worse tricks than these are those of the <i lang="de">Wilder
Mann</i>. When the soil is sterile and ungrateful; when any of the
wonted promises of nature are unfulfilled; when the axe of the lonely
woodman rebounds from the stubborn trunk and wounds him; when the foot
of the practised mountain-climber fails him on the crisp snow, or the
treacherously sun-parched heather; when a wild and lawless wight (for
such there are even in Tirol, though fewer, perhaps, than elsewhere)
illtreats the girl who has gone forth to tend her father&rsquo;s flock
upon the mountains, trusting in her own innocence and Heaven&rsquo;s
help for her protection&mdash;it is always the <i lang="de">Wilder
Mann</i>&mdash;in some places called the <i lang="de">Wilder
J&ouml;rgel</i>, in others, the <i>Lorg</i>, the <i>Salvang</i> or
<i>Gannes</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>the <i>Klaubaut</i> or <i lang="de">Rastalmann</i>,
in Vorarlberg, <i lang="de">Fengg</i>, <i lang=
"de">Schr&auml;ttlig</i>, <i>Doggi</i>, and
<i>Haberg&acirc;ss</i>&mdash;to whose account the misfortune or the
misdeed is laid. His female counterpart is called <i>Trude</i> and
<i>Stampa</i>, and the <i>Langt&uuml;ttin</i>.</p>
<p>The mineral riches of the country, and the miners occupied in
searching for them, are told of as of hidden treasure sought after or
revealed, as the case may be, by the <i lang="de">Bergweib</i> and the
<i lang="de">Bergmannlein</i>, or <i lang="de">Erdmannlein</i>, the
<i lang="de">Venedigermannlein</i> and the <i lang=
"de">Hahnenkekerle</i>, the stories of whose strength and generosity,
cupidity and spite, are endless; while the mountain echoes are the
voices of sprites playfully imitating the sounds of human life.</p>
<p>If the mountains and the forests are thus treated, neither are the
lakes and torrents without their share of personification, and many are
the legends in which the uses and beauties of the beneficent element
are interpreted to be the smiles and the helpful acts of the
<span lang="de">Wasserfra&uuml;lein</span>, while the mischances which
occur at the water&rsquo;s edge are ascribed to the <i lang=
"de">Stromkarl</i> and the <i lang="de">Br&uuml;ckengeist</i>.</p>
<p>The sudden convulsions of nature to which their soil has been
subject from age to age are all charged with retribution for the sins
of the people, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities
of the plain. Castles and forest possessions of wicked rich men are
sunk beneath the waters of lakes so that their foundations may
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>never again be set up, and their place be no more
found; while a curse pursues those who attempt to dig out the
ill-gotten treasure. Villages are recorded to have been swallowed by
the earth or buried by the snow-storms when their people have neglected
the commandments of God.</p>
<p>This literal adaptation of the admonitions of Holy Writ receives
among this people another development in traditions of instances where
good deeds done to the poor have been believed to have been actually
done to visions of our Lord and of His Saints. Then again, their devout
belief in both the irresistible justice and the ineffable love of God
convinces them that there must be a place on earth where souls too
soiled for heaven, yet not given over to utter reprobation, may wander
till the final day of rest. And thus every shepherd, as he keeps his
lonely watch upon the Alpine pastures, expects that he may meet the
<i lang="de">feurige Sennin</i> who broke the Sunday rest; or the
<i lang="de">Tscheier Friedl</i> who was cruel to the cattle in his
charge; or the <i lang="de">b&uuml;ssender Hirt</i> who stole the
widow&rsquo;s kine; or the <i lang="de">Markegger</i> who removed his
neighbour&rsquo;s landmark; or the <i lang="de">Pungga-Mannl</i> who
swore a false oath; or the <i lang="de">feuriger Verr&auml;ther</i> who
betrayed the mountain pass to the Roman legions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the heroes and types of the Christian faith are
thought of as taking a perpetual interest in the welfare of their
struggling brethren: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9"
name="pb9">9</a>]</span>St. Nothburga and St. Isidore watch over the
husbandman, and St. Urban over the vinedresser; St. Martin over the
mower; St. Martha, St. Sebastian, and St. Rocchus, the <i lang=
"de">drei Pestschutzheiligen</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e636src"
href="#xd21e636" name="xd21e636src">5</a>, are expected to be as potent
in their intercession now as when at their prayers, when on earth,
plagues were stayed. St. Anthony and St. Florian similarly protect
against fire. St. Vigilius, the evangelizer of the country and martyr
to his zeal, is still believed to guard its jealously-preserved unity
of faith. In return, they receive special veneration: the ordinary
dealings of life are regulated by the recurrence of their festivals,
and the memory of sacred mysteries is kept in perpetual honour by
setting up their tokens in every homestead and every house, in every
vineyard and in every field, on every bridge and by every wayside.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that a people so minded have tales to tell of
wonderful events which seem to have befallen them, and which take the
record of their lives out of the prosaic monotony which rules our
own,&mdash;tales always bearing a wholesome moral lesson, always
showing trust in Providence and faith in the World Unseen, and always
told with the charming simplicity which only a logically grounded
expectation that events should turn out even so&mdash;and no invention
or imagination&mdash;can give. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10"
href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span></p>
<p>A selection of these tales I have put into English dress in the
following pages. Though some few of them may be found to bear analogy
with similar tales of other German nations, the distinctive qualities
of the Tirolese, and the peculiar nature of the scenery amid which they
have been conceived, will be found to have stamped them with a
character entirely their own.</p>
<p>I think that what I have said is sufficient to give, to such of my
readers as did not possess it already, the key to their application,
and I need not now append to each a tedious interpretation of the
fantastic personages and scenes I shall have to introduce.</p>
<p>It remains only to say a word as to their distribution. The present
principality of Tirol is composed of four provinces. North Tirol, South
Tirol, W&auml;lsch or Italian Tirol, and Vorarlberg. North and South
Tirol have been for long so closely united that, like their language
and customs, their mythology has become so intimately intermingled that
it scarcely comes within the scope of a work like the present to point
out their few divergences or local peculiarities. But those of
W&auml;lsch Tirol and Vorarlberg each maintain a much more distinctive
character, and I have accordingly marked with a separate heading those
which I have gathered thence. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href=
"#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">The Rose-garden of King
Lareyn</span>,&rdquo; however, is not the peculiar property of any one
province. Though the three places which claim to occupy its site are
all placed in South Tirol, this pretty myth is the common property of
the whole country&mdash;its chief popular epic&mdash;and has even
passed into the folklore of other parts of Germany also. It is beside
the purpose of the present little work to enter into the controversy
which has been raised concerning the authorship. There can be little
doubt, however, that it was originally the utterance of some unknown
minstrel putting into rough-and-ready rhyme one of the floating myths
which symbolized the conflict of the heroes with the powers of evil, so
popular in the middle ages. Then poets of more pretensions wrote out,
and, as they wrote out, improved the song. Thus there are several
different manuscripts of it extant, of between two and three thousand
lines each, but not of equal value, for later scribes, in trying to
improve, overlaid the simple energy of its diction with a feeble
attempt at ornament which only served to damage its force. The name of
the Norg-king who is the subject of it, is in these spelt variously, as
Lareyn, Luarin, Luarine, &amp;c.; the modern orthography is Laurin. The
spelling I have adopted is that of the <i>Chronicon</i> of Aventinus.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span></p>
<p>I have thought it well to precede the story by some account of the
Norg folk and some samples of their legends, that the reader may not
come wholly unacquainted with their traditional character to the tale
of the discomfiture of the last Norg-king. <span class=

<h2 class="main">NORG MYTHS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Norgen were a mighty folk in olden time in Tirol.
In their span-high bodies resided a power which no child of man, were
he ever so stalwart and well-limbed, could resist. But they were also
for the most part a peaceable race, and more inclined to assist than to
obstruct the industrious inhabitants of the country in their labours;
so long as they were treated with respect and deference they seldom
interfered with any one. Then they were generally scrupulously
honourable, and strict keepers of their word. A service rendered one of
them was sure to be repaid a hundredfold. An injury brought a
corresponding retribution, and scorn, contempt, or ridicule roused
their utmost vengeance; while some there were who entertained a true
spirit of mischief, and indulged in wanton tricks which showed their
character was not altogether free from malice.</p>
<p>They were most often to be met in lonely paths and unfrequented
fastnesses of nature, but a solitary <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>N&ouml;rglein could also
occasionally stray within the haunts of men, at times asking
hospitality at their hands, and at others getting into the bedrooms at
night, and teasing the children in their sleep, hence the common
proverb&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Shut the door closely to,</p>
<p class="line">Or the Norg will come through<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e676src" href="#xd21e676" name="xd21e676src">1</a>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And at other times, again, they would take part in the
field and household labours, as if they found it sport. The name of
Norg was chiefly appropriated to them in South Tirol; in Vorarlberg the
analogous cobbold went by the name of <i lang="de">Rutschifenggen</i>.
Every locality, every valley, every hamlet, and almost every farm, had
its own familiar dwarf whose doings were handed down as household
words.</p>
<p id="eggshells">Thus it is told that there was once a countrywoman,
who lived in a lonely Meierhof<a class="noteref" id="xd21e693src" href=
"#xd21e693" name="xd21e693src">2</a> of the Passeierthal, standing over
her stove, preparing a pancake for her husband&rsquo;s dinner, and as
he was a great eater she used an immense number of eggs&mdash;three
dozen and more&mdash;in his pancake: as fast as she broke the eggs into
the pan, she threw the shells behind her. Three Norgs came by as she
was so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>occupied and amused themselves with playing with
them and arranging them into all kinds of patterns. The
Meierin<a class="noteref" id="xd21e701src" href="#xd21e701" name=
"xd21e701src">3</a> was a grumpy sort of woman, and instead of finding
pleasure in the glee of the little people, grew cross with them, and
scattered the dirty black ashes among the egg-shells they had arranged
so prettily. Offended at this ill-natured treatment, the Norgs took
their departure, but first laid the thread of the good wife&rsquo;s
spinning-bobbin as a snare across the floor, and then stationed
themselves outside the window to see what happened.</p>
<p>Presently the husband called to know if the pancake was not ready,
and the Meierin, running to satisfy him, with both hands engaged in
holding the dish of the enormous pancake, caught her feet in the
thread, and fell flat on the ground with her face in the dish, while
the three Norgs completed her vexation by setting up a loud laugh in
chorus.</p>
<p id="reckoning">Here is another story of their doings, in which they
play a different part. There was a storm in the valley of Matsch, and a
storm in the valley of Matsch is often a terrible matter. This was one
of the worst: the pitiless flood streamed down the heights, and
threatened to overflow the banks of the <i lang=
"de">Hochseen</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e710src" href="#xd21e710"
name="xd21e710src">4</a>; the wind from the glacier howled <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>dismally
over the mountain-sides; the people closed their doors and shutters
against the blast, and listened to the roar of the elements, trembling
with the thought that every moment might come the signal of the
inundation which should carry them and their habitations away in its
torrent. In the solidest and most important house of the straggling
village, which bears the same name as the valley, was gathered the
family of the richest man of the place, who had no reason to share
these fears, but with singing and lively conversation chased away the
dismal influence of the lugubrious sounds without.</p>
<p>Suddenly, between the angry gusts of wind, a doleful voice was heard
piteously praying for help. One of the party opened the casement, and
looked out, but with more of curiosity than interest, and then quickly
closing it again, came back into the room with a laugh to describe the
ludicrous figure he had seen. It was a little mannikin with a beard big
enough for a full-grown man, his clothes drenched with the rain, and
slung over his shoulder a tiny bundle tied in a handkerchief, which yet
seemed to bow him down with its weight. The description provoked a
chorus of laughter, and the wretched little Norg&mdash;for it was a
Norg&mdash;would have been no more thought of but that his wail became
more irritating than that of the wind, and at last the master of the
house got up and shouted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href=
"#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>to him to go on, for it was useless
to stand droning there, he was not going to open his house at that time
of night, or to such a ridiculous object. But though he banged the
window to as closely as possible after delivering himself of this
speech, the little man&rsquo;s menacing couplet yet reached his
ear&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The reckoning day</p>
<p class="line">Is not far away<a class="noteref" id="xd21e724src"
href="#xd21e724" name="xd21e724src">5</a>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Nevertheless the Norg begged no more, but endeavoured
to pass on his way. He could not get far: the torrents of rain had
obliterated the path which led from the rising ground on which this
house was built, to the next, and it was scarcely safe to descend in
the dark with the loose stones rattling away under the feet.
Fortunately a glimmering light betrayed a low hut built into the slope.
It looked so poor and humble, that the Norg felt ashamed to ask aught
of its inhabitants, who could scarcely have had enough for their own
needs; but when he saw how utterly forlorn was his position, he sat
down on a stone, and wept. Notwithstanding that the poor little Norg
had such a hoarse voice that it was more like that of a wild animal
than a man, there was a compassionate little maid within who perceived
it was a voice of distress, and put her head out to ask who was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>there. &ldquo;Poor old man!&rdquo; she cried;
&ldquo;come inside and dry yourself, and let me give you something
warm.&rdquo; But before he could answer he heard a weak voice within,
&ldquo;Beware, Theresl, of the wolves&mdash;remember we are in
&lsquo;<span lang="de">Matsch der W&ouml;lfe Heimath</span><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e740src" href="#xd21e740" name=
"xd21e740src">6</a>.&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;Never fear, mother
dear,&rdquo; replied the maiden, &ldquo;this is no wolf, but a very
distressed little old man, who does not look as if he could harm any
one; and besides we are now in June&mdash;the wolves don&rsquo;t
threaten us in the summer,&rdquo; and she opened the door, and let in
the little man.</p>
<p>By the time she had dried his clothes and fed him with some warm
soup, the worst of the storm had abated, and he was able to go on his
way. The maiden offered him shelter for the night, but he declared he
must reach home before midnight, and prepared to depart. Before he left
he asked her what there was she most desired. &ldquo;Oh, that my mother
be restored to health!&rdquo; answered Theresa; &ldquo;I desire nothing
more than that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Norg walked to the bedside, and informed himself of the nature
of the sick mother&rsquo;s illness. &ldquo;Your mother shall be
cured,&rdquo; said the little man; &ldquo;but you must come to me
to-morrow at midnight to the N&ouml;rgelspitz;&rdquo; and as the girl
started at the impossibility of the feat, he continued, &ldquo;You have
only to make your way as far as the <i lang="de">Wetterkreuz</i>,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>and there call three times &lsquo;Kruzinegele!
Kruzinegele! Kruzinegele!&rsquo; and I will be at your side, and take
you up the rest of the way.&rdquo; And he took his departure,
singing,&mdash;</p>
<div lang="de" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Morgen oder Heut</p>
<p class="line">Kommt die Zahlzeit.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The next night Theresa courageously set out on her
way, and climbed as far as the <i lang="de">Wetterkreuz</i>&mdash;and
it was lucky she had to go no farther, for here she sank down quite
exhausted. She had not lain there many seconds when she saw a
procession of little men just like Kruzinegele, with a litter and
torches, who carried her up till they came to a door in the rock, which
opened at their approach. This led to a magnificent crystal hall
glittering with gold and gems, and on a gold throne sat Kruzinegele
himself, with his fair daughter by his side. When the litter was
brought to the steps of the throne, he came down courteously, and
renewed his thanks for her hospitality, but she could not find a word
to say, in her astonishment at seeing him so changed. Meantime he sent
his daughter to fetch the herbs which were to cure the poor mother, and
gave them to her, telling her how to administer them. &ldquo;You
see,&rdquo; he added,&mdash;</p>
<div lang="de" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Morgen oder Heut</p>
<p class="line">Kommt die Zahlzeit;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">and your rich neighbour will find it so too.&rdquo;
Then <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>he told the little men to carry her home, and they
laid her in the litter, and bore her away; and she remembered nothing
more till she found herself comfortably in bed, with the rising sun
kissing her cheeks. But the appearance of every thing was as much
changed as Kruzinegele himself had been! The walls that used to bulge,
and reek with mildew and damp, were straight and smooth; glass
casements replaced the ricketty shutters; nice white curtains tempered
the sunshine; the scanty and broken furniture was replaced by new. But
what she valued above all, in her hand were the herbs which were to
make her mother&rsquo;s healing drink! Their decoction was her first
occupation; and by the next day they had restored her mother to health,
and joy once more reigned in the cottage, thanks to the Norg!</p>
<p>It had been the rich churl&rsquo;s custom, equally with the other
villagers, to take his cattle on to the mountain pastures to graze for
the beginning of the summer season <i lang="de">am Johanni</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e776src" href="#xd21e776" name="xd21e776src">7</a>.
His grazing ground was just the highest pasture of the
N&ouml;rgelspitz. The festival now soon arrived, and the picturesque
processions of cattle with their herds went lowing forth as usual, to
enjoy their summer feed.</p>
<p>When the Norg&rsquo;s enemy, however, arrived at his destination,
instead of the emerald slopes he was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>wont to find, with their
rich yield of <i>marbel</i> and <i>maim</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e788src" href="#xd21e788" name="xd21e788src">8</a>, all ready
prepared by St. Martin&rsquo;s care<a class="noteref" id="xd21e791src"
href="#xd21e791" name="xd21e791src">9</a> for the delight of his cows
and sheep, all was stony and desolate! Three days they spent wandering
about in search of a few blades to browse, but even this was denied
them&mdash;nor ever again did the N&ouml;rgelspitz bring forth any
thing but ice and snow!</p>
<p>Of the sleek droves which had started, the envy of all beholders,
few beasts lived to return; the prosperity of the once flourishing
<i>Hof</i> had fled, and before many years were out its proprietor was
obliged to leave it, a ruined man. Theresa had in the meantime married
a thrifty peasant, whose industry enabled him to be the purchaser of
the abandoned Hof, which he soon stocked to the full extent of former
days. Ofttimes a curious grey-bearded little stranger would drop in at
night to share their comfortable meal, and before he went away he would
always sing his couplet&mdash;</p>
<div lang="de" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Morgen oder Heut</p>
<p class="line">Kommt die Zahlzeit.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Such occasional apparitions of the strange visitants
excited the curiosity of the inhabitants of the earth to the utmost,
and many a weird story was told of frightful injury happening to those
who had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>striven to penetrate their retreat, and for a long
period none had any success in the enterprise.</p>
<p id="fritzl">It happened one day, however, that a daring hunter who
had been led far from his usual track, and far from the country with
which he was familiar, by the pursuit of a gemsbock, found himself at
the entrance of a low-arched cavern. As night was about to fall and the
sky wore a threatening aspect, he was glad to creep within this shelter
till the light of morning should enable him to find his way home once
more.</p>
<p>He had not proceeded far within the dim corridor, when he perceived
that in proportion as he got farther from the light of day the cave
became brighter instead of darker! Eagerly seeking the cause of this
phenomenon, he perceived that the walls were all encrusted with gold
and precious stones, which emitted constant sparkles of light. He
thereby recognized at once that he had reached an approach to one of
the resorts of the Mountain-folk, as the Norgs were also called from
having their habitation in the hearts of the mountains.</p>
<p>To avoid the fate of those who had ventured within the mysterious
precincts, he was about to make good his escape, when he felt something
soft under his feet. It proved to be a red hood or cap, dropped there
by one of the Mountain-folk, a veritable <i>Tarnkappe</i> which had the
property of making the wearer invisible to men, and also enabled him to
command admission to any part of the subterranean <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>settlement. He had scarcely placed it on his head
when one of the little men of the mountain came running up to look for
his lost cap. Fritzl the hunter was much too cunning to give up the
advantage of its possession, but with great good humour he told the
dwarf he reckoned it too great an advantage to have the opportunity of
visiting his beautiful territory to give it up for nothing; but he
assured him he should have no reason to regret having given him
admission. The dwarf could not choose but obey, and the
<i>J&auml;ger</i> enjoyed the singular privilege of surveying all the
hidden treasures of the underground world.</p>
<p>Beautiful are the glories of the mountain world as seen by mortal
eyes&mdash;gorgeous its colours when illumined by the southern sun, but
all this is as barren darkness compared with the glories hidden within
its stony recesses. Here, the sky overhead was all of diamonds and
sapphires and carbuncles, and their light sparkled with tenfold glory
and beauty to the light of the sun and moon and stars; the trees were
of living gold and silver, and the flowers and fruit of precious
stones; the grass all of crystal and emerald; there was no cold or
heat, no perplexing change of season, but one perpetual spring spread
its balmy air around; lakes there were all of opal and
mother-o&rsquo;-pearl, and gorgeously plumed swans perpetually crossing
them served the inhabitants in lieu of boats. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span></p>
<p>The <i>J&auml;ger&rsquo;s</i> delight and admiration at all these
sights won the sympathy and regard of his guide, and by degrees he grew
more communicative, and explained to him the whole economy of their
mode of life. He showed him how they were divided into three distinct
classes: those wearing red caps, who were gay and good-natured, and
filled with goodwill towards mankind also, notwithstanding many wild
pranks; those with brown caps, whose mischief was mingled with malice
rather than fun, but who yet would suffer themselves to be propitiated;
and those with black caps, always gloomy and morose, who boded evil
wherever they went. His guide advised him to have nothing to say to
these, but with some of the red and brown he was admitted to converse:
he found them pleasant and sociable, and ready enough to communicate
their ideas. Some asked him questions, too, about various matters which
seemed to have puzzled them in their peregrinations on earth, while
others, who had never been outside their own habitations, had other
inquiries to make&mdash;but some there were also who had no curiosity
on the subject, but rather contempt; and one thing that amused the
<i>J&auml;ger</i> in them was their incapacity to conceive many of the
things he had to tell them, and particularly to understand what he
could mean when he talked about death.</p>
<p>Chiefly to keep the spiteful freaks of the black-caps <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>in check
there was a guard of warrior dwarfs, whose array was shown to our
<i>J&auml;ger</i>. Formidable they must have been, for the armour of
each was made out of one diamond, and they wore helmets and greaves and
shields all of diamonds, and while they were thus impervious to every
attack, their swords were of diamond too, and resistless therefore in
their thrusts.</p>
<p>The <i>J&auml;ger</i> could not restrain his raptures at their
gorgeous show, as the colours of the gems around were reflected in this
shining armour.</p>
<p>The dwarf had nothing left to show after this, but then stood and
sighed over the glories of the past. &ldquo;And what were the glories
of the past?&rdquo; inquired the <i>J&auml;ger</i>, with intense
interest. The dwarf watched his interlocutor closely, and satisfied
himself that his interest was not feigned. Then he paused long, as
hesitating whether to unburden himself to a stranger of the sad
thoughts which crowded into and oppressed his mind. A few words of
sympathy, however, decided him at last</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we still have some power and some riches left, and some
of our ancient strength, but we have lost our kings, the kernel of our
strength. It is true, we are able to surprise you with isolated
exhibitions of riches and power, but, on the whole, your people has got
the better of ours; and since your heroes of old destroyed the last of
our royal race, we have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href=
"#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>been a doomed, disorganized,
dwindling race, fast disappearing from our ancient
fastnesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how happened it that our people got the better of yours?
How did our heroes destroy your royal race? I pray you tell
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dwarf led the <i>J&auml;ger</i> into a delicious alcove of the
opal rock, whose pure, pale lustre seemed more in accordance with his
melancholy mood than the garish brilliancies that had hitherto
surrounded them. They laid them down on the bank, and the dwarf thus
recounted the story.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">THE ROSE-GARDEN OF LAREYN, THE LAST NORG-KING.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The lineage of our kings had endured for countless
generations, he said, and had always enjoyed the undeviating homage of
our people.</p>
<p>In our kings were bound up our life and our strength; they were the
fountain of our light and the guardians of our power. The royal race
was a race apart which had never mingled with the race of the governed,
yet which had never failed or been found wanting. But Adelgar cast his
eyes on H&ouml;rele, one of the Norginnen of the common herd, and
raised her to share his throne. The union not only was
unblessed&mdash;what was worse, all the rest of the royal stock died
out, and all the noble <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27"
name="pb27">27</a>]</span>princes of his first marriage died away one
after the other<a class="noteref" id="xd21e872src" href="#xd21e872"
name="xd21e872src">10</a>; and when H&ouml;rele at last came to die
herself, there was only one left.</p>
<p>This was Lareyn, the last of his race. Adelgar looked around him
with tears, for there was none left to whom he could marry his son, and
he had experienced in himself the ill effects of departing from the
ancient tradition which forbade him from mingling his race with the
race of the governed, and he bewailed his folly.</p>
<p>But Lareyn bethought him of a remedy; he determined to go out into
the outer world, and choose him a wife among the daughters of its
inhabitants, and bring her to reign over the mountain people and
continue the royal stock. In a supreme council of the elders of the
kingdom it was decided to approve what he proposed. But Adelgar only
consented with much reluctance, and accompanied his permission with
many conditions and counsels, the chief of which were that Lareyn and
his suite should every one go forth clothed in a <i lang=
"de">Tarnhaut</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e881src" href="#xd21e881"
name="xd21e881src">11</a>, and that he should exercise his choice
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>in a far distant country where the ways of the
dwarfs were not known, and where, whatever might befall, no friend of
the bride could think of coming to his palace to seek her, for the old
king rightly judged that the Christian folk would not willingly give a
daughter of theirs to the Norgs.</p>
<p>Lareyn promised his father to attend to his injunctions, and gave
orders to prepare a thousand suits of diamond armour for his
body-guard, and five hundred suits of silk attire for his pages, who
were to bear the gifts with which he meant to captivate the maiden of
his choice, and <i lang="de">Tarnhauts</i> to cover them all&mdash;and,
above all, the presents themselves of jewels and priceless
goldsmith&rsquo;s works, at which the Norgen were very expert.</p>
<p>While all these things were being got ready Adelgar died, and Lareyn
succeeded to the crown. However much he desired to adhere to his
father&rsquo;s injunctions, he was forced to decide that under the
altered circumstances it could not be well for him to journey to a
distance from his kingdom, and to leave it long without a head. He
determined, therefore, to search the neighbourhood for a maiden that
should please him. In the meantime he made use of his newly acquired
power to prepare a dwelling to receive her which should correspond with
the magnificence of his presents, and by its dazzling <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>lustre
should make her forget all that she might be inclined to regret in her
earlier home. The highest title of honour was now promised to whoso of
his subjects could point out to him an unexplored mine of beauty and
riches. This was found in a vault all of crystal, which no foot of
dwarf had ever trod. Lareyn was beside himself with gladness when he
saw this; he ordered a hundred thousand dwarfs immediately to set to
work and form of it a residence for his bride; to divide it into
chambers for her use, with walls and columns encrusted with gold; to
engrave the crystal with pleasing devices; and to furnish it with all
that was meet for her service. Thus arose the great
Krystallburg<a class="noteref" id="xd21e903src" href="#xd21e903" name=
"xd21e903src">12</a> ever famous in the lays of the Norgs, and which
the cleverest and richest of the children of men might have envied.
That so glorious a palace might be provided with a garden worthy of it,
hundreds of thousands of other dwarfs were employed to lay out the
choicest beds and bowers that ever were seen, all planted with roses of
surpassing beauty, whose scent filled the air for miles round, so that,
wherever you might be, you should know by the fragrant exhalation where
to find the <i lang="de">Rosengarten</i> of King Lareyn<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e912src" href="#xd21e912" name="xd21e912src">13</a>.
Engrossed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>with these congenial preparations, Lareyn forgot
all his prudence and moderation: that they might be completed with all
possible expedition the whole working community of the dwarfs was drawn
off from their ordinary occupations; the cultivation of the land was
neglected, and a famine threatened. Lareyn then would go out and make a
raid on the crops of the children of earth, and take possession of
whatever was required for the needs of his own people, without regard
for the outcry raised against him, knowing that, strong in his
supernatural strength, he had no retaliation to fear.</p>
<p>While thus he pursued his ravages every where with indiscriminating
fury, he one day came upon the <i lang="it">arativo</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e923src" href="#xd21e923" name="xd21e923src">14</a>
of a poor widow whose only son was her one support. The golden grain
had been gathered into her modest barn just as Lareyn and his marauders
came by; swift, like a flock of locusts, they had seized the treasure.
The widow sobbed, and her stalwart son fought against them in vain;
Lareyn was inexorable. At another time the good-nature <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>of his
Norg blood would have prompted him at least to repay what he had
appropriated in the gold and precious stones of which he had such
abundant store, but now he thought of nothing but the prompt fulfilment
of his darling design; and he passed on his way unheeding the
widow&rsquo;s curse.</p>
<p>At last the Krystallburg was complete, and the Rosengarten budding
ready to burst into a bloom of beauty. To so fair a garden he would
have no other fence but a girdle of silk, only he gave it for further
defence a law whereby any who should violate that bound should forfeit
his left foot and his right hand.</p>
<p>Lareyn looked round, and his heart was content. He felt satisfied
now that he had wherewithal to make any daughter of earth forget her
own home and her father&rsquo;s people, how delightful soever might
have been the place of her previous sojourn.</p>
<p>Donning his <i>Tarnhaut</i>, he went forth with his followers
marshalled behind him, all equally hidden from human sight.</p>
<p>He wandered from castle to castle, from <i>Edelsitz</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e942src" href="#xd21e942" name="xd21e942src">15</a>
to <i>Edelsitz</i>, from palace to palace, but nowhere found he the
bride of his heart, till he came to the residence of the Duke of
Styria. Here, in a garden almost as lovely as his own Rose-garden, he
found a number of noble knights assembled, and their ladies,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>all of surpassing beauty, taking their pleasure on
the greensward amid the flowers.</p>
<p>Lareyn had never seen so much beauty and gallantry, and he lingered
long with his attendant wights running from one to another, and
scanning the attractions of each, as a bee hovers from flower to
flower, gathering the honey from their lips. Each maiden was so
perfect, that he would have been content with any one of them, but each
was so guarded by her cavalier that he saw no way of approaching her;
at last, driven to despair, he wandered away under the shade of a
lonesome grove.</p>
<p>Here, under a leafy lime<a class="noteref" id="xd21e954src" href=
"#xd21e954" name="xd21e954src">16</a>, his eye met a form of loveliness
which surpassed the loveliness of all the dames he had heretofore seen
put together, and he felt thankful now that he had not been able to
possess himself of any of them, for then he had never seen her who now
lay before him in all the bloom of her virgin perfection. Lareyn,
accustomed to associate his conceptions of beauty with a dazzling blaze
of gold and jewels, found an entirely new source of admiration in the
simple attire of the Styrian princess, for it was Simild, daughter of
Biterolf, Duke of Styria, who lay before him, seeking rest amid the
midday heat, draped only in virgin white, with wreathed lilies for her
single ornament. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span></p>
<p>Lareyn stood absorbed for some time in contemplation of her perfect
image. Then, hearing the voices of her companions drawing near, quickly
he flung a <i>Tarnhaut</i> over her, so that they trooped by, searching
for her, and passed on&mdash;seeing her not&mdash;to seek her farther.
Then he beckoned to the bearers of a litter he had prepared in
readiness to approach, into which her sylph-like form was soon laid;
and over hill and dale he carried her towards the <i lang=
"de">Rosengarten</i>.</p>
<p>They had got some way before Simild woke. Lareyn rode by her side,
watching for her eyes to open, and the moment she gave signs of
consciousness he made a sign for the <i>cort&eacute;ge</i> to halt.
Quick as thought a refection was laid out on the greensward, while a
band of Norg musicians performed the most delicious melody.</p>
<p>Simild, enraptured with the new sights and sounds, gazed around,
wondering where she was and what all the little creatures could be who
hopped around ministering to her with so much thoughtfulness. Lareyn
hastened to soothe her, but fancying that some of the Norgs were
wanting in some of their due services to her, he rated them in such a
positive tone of command that Simild began to perceive that he was the
master of this regiment of ministrants, and hence she inferred that by
some mysterious means she had fallen into his power; but what those
means could be she was at a loss to conceive. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p>Lareyn now displayed his presents, and in presenting them poured
forth the most enthusiastic praise of her beauty. Simild&rsquo;s vanity
and curiosity were both won; yet the strangeness of the situation, the
sudden separation from her friends, her ignorance of what might be
going to befall her, roused all her fears, and she continued to repeat
in answer to all his protestations of admiration that she could listen
to nothing from him till he had restored her to her home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the one thing, sweet princess, that I cannot do at
your bidding,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Whatever else you desire me to
do shall be instantly executed. And it is hardly possible for you to
exhaust my capacity of serving you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he went on to describe the magnificence and riches of his
kingdom, and all the glories over which, as his bride, she would be
called to reign, till her curiosity was so deeply excited, and her
opposition to his carrying her farther grew so faint, that he lost no
time in taking advantage of her mood to pursue the journey.</p>
<p>In the meantime the greatest consternation had fallen on all the
friends of Simild. The maidens whose duty it was to wait on her sought
her every where, and not finding her they were afraid to appear before
her father. The knights and nobles who had been in her company were
distracted, feeling the duty upon them to restore her, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>and not
knowing which way to begin. The old Duke Biterolf shut himself up
within the palace and wept, objecting to see any one, for his heart was
oppressed with sorrow; and he refused to be comforted till his child
should be restored to him.</p>
<p>But Dietlieb, Simild&rsquo;s brother, a stout young sword<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e989src" href="#xd21e989" name="xd21e989src">17</a>,
when he had exhausted every counsel that occurred to him for
discovering his sister&rsquo;s retreat, determined to ride to Gardenna
on the Garda-See, the castle where resided Hildebrand<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1001src" href="#xd21e1001" name="xd21e1001src">18</a> the
Sage, renowned for wisdom, and prudence, and useful counsel.</p>
<p>When Hildebrand the Sage saw him come riding yet a long way off, he
said to those who stood beside him on the battlements, &ldquo;See
Dietlieb the Styrian, how he rides! His heart is full of indignation.
Up, my men, there is work for us; some one has done him a great wrong,
and us it behoves to stand by him, and see him righted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ute, Hildebrand&rsquo;s wife, and her daughters prepared
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>a warm welcome for the prince, as was due; and the
heroes gathered round Hildebrand held out their hands to him as to one
whose integrity and valour claimed their respect. Hildebrand himself
led him to his chamber, and left to no maiden the task of helping him
off with his armour<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1011src" href=
"#xd21e1011" name="xd21e1011src">19</a>, but with his own hand lifted
off his helmet and laid by his good shield.</p>
<p>Then they placed refreshing wine from the cool cellar in the rock
before him, and a banquet of many dishes, as became so worthy a guest.
When the tables had been removed<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1016src"
href="#xd21e1016" name="xd21e1016src">20</a>, Hildebrand invited his
young guest to detail the cause which had brought him. Dietlieb, who
was burning to tell the story of his mishap, poured out the details of
his sister&rsquo;s misadventure, without omitting the smallest incident
which could serve Hildebrand to form an opinion as to the remedy to be
adopted.</p>
<p>The event was so strange that Hildebrand himself could not venture
all at once to divine the nature of the injury. But he forbore also to
express his perplexity, lest the bold young Styrian should be
discouraged. Without therefore expounding exactly what his views were,
but determining to ponder the matter more deeply by the way, the advice
he propounded in the first instance was, that they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>should
all repair forthwith to seek the aid of Berndietrich<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1023src" href="#xd21e1023" name="xd21e1023src">21</a>.</p>
<p>The counsel was received with joyful acclamation; and loud was the
clanging as every one ran to don his chain-armour, for all were glad to
be called to deeds of high emprise, and such they deemed were in store
for them if Dietrich von Bern was to be their leader.</p>
<p>Ute and her daughters, to whom their courage and mettle was well
known, greeted them as they went forth with no sinking hearts, but gave
them augury of good success.</p>
<p>As they journeyed along, they came to a broad heath, which they were
about to pass over with their train, when up sprang a man of forlorn
aspect, who cried after Hildebrand, and asked his aid.</p>
<p>Hildebrand, seeing him in such sorry plight, turned aside out of
compassion, to ask what had befallen him. It was no other than the
peasant&mdash;the widow&rsquo;s son&mdash;whom Lareyn had so deeply
wronged, and, seeing the heroes go forth in such brave array, he
besought their aid against the oppressor of his mother. Some of them
laughed at his wild mien and uncouth gestures, but Hildebrand the Sage
took him apart, and lost not a word of his story of how the Norg-king
lived in the heart of the mountains, of how he came out with his mighty
little men, and ravaged all the face of the country, contrary
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>to all the habits of his former life, and of how
it was all because his own labourers were engaged in preparing the most
magnificent palace for the reception of a daughter of earth, whom he
meant to make his bride.</p>
<p>Hildebrand now felt he knew all, and with the help of the poor
countryman, the widow&rsquo;s son, would be able to conduct the heroes
into his retreat, inflict condign punishment, and release the captive
princess.</p>
<p>How, with purely natural means, to overcome the resistless strength
of the Norgs did not indeed make itself apparent; this was matter for
further consideration, and sufficed to engross his thoughts for the
rest of the journey. Of one thing he was satisfied&mdash;that he was
right in claiming the intervention of Berndietrich, whose traffic with
the supernatural powers<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1040src" href=
"#xd21e1040" name="xd21e1040src">22</a> made him, of all the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>wigands<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1066src" href=
"#xd21e1066" name="xd21e1066src">23</a>, alone capable of conducting
such an expedition.</p>
<p>Hildebrand and his companions were received by Theodoric with hearty
welcome and hospitable care and cheer. As they sat at table, all the
heroes together vied with each other in lauding the prowess of
Theodoric, till they had pronounced him the bravest sword of which the
whole world could boast.</p>
<p>This was the time for Hildebrand. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he cried, as he
upsprang, and by his determined manner <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>arrested the attention of
all the wigands. &ldquo;No, I say! there is one mightier than he; there
is one with whom he has never yet ventured to measure his
strength&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? Name him!&rdquo; shouted Theodoric, rising to his feet,
and glaring round him with defiant fury, only kept in check by his
regard for Hildebrand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I speak of Lareyn, the Dwarf-king, the dweller in the depths
of the mountains of Tirol,&rdquo; replied Hildebrand, in a voice of
firm assurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Dwarf-king!&rdquo; exclaimed Theodoric, with incredulity
and contempt; and he sat down again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as the Dwarf-king is suffered to live in his mountain
stronghold, and to ravage the lands of the peaceful peasants, I call no
man who knows of him a hero. But him who overcomes this little
one&mdash;him I will call a hero indeed, above all others!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your Dwarf-king were so formidable, <i>Meister</i>
Hildebrand,&rdquo; replied Theodoric, &ldquo;you would have told me of
him before now, I ween. How has he raised your wonderment just at this
time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because just at this time his insolence has increased. He has
built a palace surpassing all palaces in magnificence, which he calls
his Krystallburg, and has surrounded it with a garden of beauty, which
he calls his Rosengarten, fenced round only with a silken girdle, but
of whomsoever crosses that boundary he forfeits the left foot and the
right hand.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41"
name="pb41">41</a>]</span></p>
<p>The report of this boast was enough to decide Theodoric, the
impetuous sword. &ldquo;If it is thus he vaunts him,&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;he shall know that there is one will dare brave his decree, and
destroy the garden his ferocity guards after the manner you
describe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that up he rose, and called for his Velsungen<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1096src" href="#xd21e1096" name="xd21e1096src">24</a>, for his
armour he never put off, and he called for his helmet and his horse;
and before another had time to frame his purpose, he had started,
without parley and without guide.</p>
<p>Only Wittich the Wigand, his boon companion, who loved to share his
rash ventures, and was familiar with his moods, could bestir himself to
follow before he was too far gone to be overtaken.</p>
<p>To Tirol they rode by day and by night, without slacking rein, for
their anger brooked no reprieve. They slacked not their speed for dell
or mountain, and they rode forty miles through the dense forest; but
every where as they went along they tested the air, as it was wafted
past them, to see if they could discern the perfumes of the
Rosengarten. At last, as they toiled up the mountain side, a majestic
sight was suddenly opened to their view. The white shining rock of the
living mountain was cut <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href=
"#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>and fashioned into every pleasing
device of turret and tower, diamonds and rubies were the windows, and
the dome was of pure gold set with precious stones. &ldquo;We have far
to ride yet,&rdquo; said Wittich the Wigand, as he scanned the lordly
place. &ldquo;And yet the perfume of the Rose-garden reaches even
hither,&rdquo; said the <i>Bern&auml;re</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1110src" href="#xd21e1110" name="xd21e1110src">25</a>.
&ldquo;Then we know we are on the right track,&rdquo; answered Wittich;
so they put spurs to their horses, and rode forward with good
heart.</p>
<p>They had pushed on thus many a mile when the blooming Rosengarten
itself came in sight, entrancing their senses with its beauty and its
odours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; asked Theodoric, who always rode ahead,
as some light obstruction made his mount swerve for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you have burst the silken girdle of King Lareyn&rsquo;s
Rosengarten!&rdquo; said Wittich the Wigand; &ldquo;so now we have
incurred the vengeance of the little man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Theodoric, as he gazed around, &ldquo;let us
not harm this pleasant place; sweetly are the flowers disposed, and in
the fragrant hours of evening and of morning it must be well to be
here: let us destroy naught!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay!&rdquo; said honest Wittich, &ldquo;came we not forth to
destroy this devil&rsquo;s-work, and to reduce the pride of the
boasting Norg-king who spares none? Shall we return, and leave our work
undone? I have no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43"
name="pb43">43</a>]</span>such mind; nothing will I leave of what we
see before us now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dismounted to carry his threat into effect; and Theodoric, not to
be behindhand, or to incur suspicion of fearing the Norg-king,
dismounted too. Then with one consent they hewed down and rooted up the
fair plants, till the whole garden was a wilderness, and they lay them
down upon the grass to rest.</p>
<p>As they lay, there appeared before them, coming at full speed, as on
swift wings, a knightly form clad in shining armour, so that Wittich
cried, &ldquo;See, Lord Dietrich, who comes to visit us&mdash;surely it
is St. Michael, leader of the heavenly hosts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see no St. Michael,&rdquo; answered Theodoric, sullenly.
&ldquo;It is one of no heavenly build, albeit he bears him so bravely.
We may rue that we have loosed our helmets and shields, for methinks he
regards us with no loving eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they spoke the rider had advanced over a good space of the
way, and they could discern the manner of his bearing. His horse was
lithe as a roe-buck upon the wild mountain heights, and its housings of
cloth-of-gold gave back the rays of the golden sun; the bridle was
studded with precious stones, and embroidered with cunning workmanship
of gold, moreover it was held in a commanding hand. The saddle was
dazzling with rubies, and so were the stirrups no less; but the armour
was most <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>dazzling of all, and all hardened in
dragon&rsquo;s blood<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1136src" href=
"#xd21e1136" name="xd21e1136src">26</a>. His sword of adamant could cut
through steel and gold; the handle was one carbuncle, which darted rays
of light. Over his breast-armour he wore a tight tunic of
cloth-of-gold, with his arms embroidered in glowing colours. His helmet
was of burnished gold and topazes mingling their yellow light, and
between them many a carbuncle which by night gave the light of day, and
from within it there sang pleasant voices of birds&mdash;nightingales,
bulfinches, and larks, with softened voices, as if they lived, and
breathed their song upon the branches of their native trees.</p>
<p>His shield was likewise of gold, and recorded many a deed of prowess
of him who bore it; on it was painted a leopard, too, with head erect,
as though preparing to spring upon his prey. In his right hand was a
spear, and from its point floated a small red banner<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1141src" href="#xd21e1141" name="xd21e1141src">27</a>, on
which appeared two swift greyhounds intent on following the wild game.
But more imposing than all this display of gold and art was the
rider&rsquo;s majestic mien, which was as of one used to know no law
but his own will, and to be obeyed by all who approached him; and yet,
with all this, he was only a span high! For it was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>King
Lareyn, and he wore tightly buckled his girdle of
twelve-men&rsquo;s-strength.</p>
<p>Theodoric would gladly have laughed his little figure to scorn, but
when he caught the fire of his eye he was fain to acknowledge he was no
puny antagonist in fierce intention, whatever was his height.</p>
<p>Nor did Lareyn spare angry words when he had come up with the
knights, and saw what they had done; there was no epithet of scorn in
his vocabulary that he did not pour out upon them. He told them their
lives were forfeit for the mischief they had wreaked upon his roses,
and they could only redeem them by the surrender of their left foot and
right hand.</p>
<p>Theodoric was not slow to pay back his vituperation in corresponding
measure. He bid him remember what a little, wee mannikin he was; that
his was not the right tone in which he ought to talk to princes. Had he
ventured to ask a money-compensation, it would have been impertinent
enough, but what he <i>had</i> asked was a ludicrous pretention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money!&rdquo; shouted the Norg, in no way disconcerted;
&ldquo;I have more gold at command than any three of you together. You
call yourselves princes, do you? You have done no princely deed to-day;
you have incurred the common penalty which I have decreed for all alike
who trespass on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>my Rose-garden&mdash;so no more words: hand over
your horses, armour, and clothing<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1160src"
href="#xd21e1160" name="xd21e1160src">28</a>, together with the left
foot and right hand of each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herr Dietrich!&rdquo; interposed Wittich, &ldquo;is it
possible you have patience to listen to the insolent railing which this
little mite pours out in his folly? Say but the word, and I will punish
him once and for all. It needs but to take him and his mount by the
leg, with one grasp of my strong hand, and knock their heads against
the stone wall, that they may lie as dead as the roses we have already
strewn around!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God is exhaustless in His wonders!&rdquo; replied the
<i>Bern&auml;re</i>; &ldquo;for aught we know, He has laid up within
this mite&rsquo;s body all the strength of which he is so forward to
boast: or by some magic craft he may have possessed himself of might
commensurate with the riches which we can see plainly enough he has at
command. If it comes to fighting, we will bear ourselves like men; but
take my advice, and be not rash, for very much I doubt if we shall
leave these mountains of Tirol alive this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, prince of lineage high! if I knew not your prowess
before this day,&rdquo; cried Wittich, beside himself with indignation,
&ldquo;I had said you were afraid of his sword, which a mouse might
wield! Shall a Christian knight shrink before any pagan <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>hound?
But a thousand such wights as this could be overmatched by you; and
without arms you could smite them down, and hang them all on the
trees!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your ideas of your powers are not weak,&rdquo; interposed
King Lareyn; &ldquo;you talk of one of you being a match for a thousand
such as I: come on, and let us see how you will bear you against
<i>one</i> &lsquo;tiny antagonist&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wittich&rsquo;s impatience knew no bounds at the challenge; without
exchanging another word with Theodoric he sprang into the saddle, and
Lareyn, who had chafed at being spoken of as an unworthy adversary, now
drew himself up, proud to find Wittich did not scorn to meet him
mounted.</p>
<p>They rode out opposite each other on the greensward with their
lances poised, and then dashed the one at the other like two falcons on
the wing. Wittich, not at all wanting in the science of handling his
lance, made sure to have hit Lareyn, but the spell that surrounded him
protected him against the thrust, while his lance struck
Wittich&rsquo;s throat where the helm was braced, and sent him
backwards off the saddle on to the ground with great force. As he fell
among the clover he vowed that no other lance had ever so offended him,
for never before had victory appeared so easy. Hastily he sprang to his
feet, to wipe away the shame by seeming indifference; but Lareyn stood
before him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>in the long grass with his sword ready to take the
forfeit he demanded, the left foot and the right hand,&mdash;and
<i>would</i> have taken it, but Theodoric deemed it time to interfere;
he said he should have reckoned it a shame on him could it have been
said of him that he had stood by while a companion was made to pay so
hard a penalty for so small a harm.<a id="xd21e1188" name=
"xd21e1188"></a></p>
<p>&ldquo;What is a shame to you is no affair of mine,&rdquo; cried
Lareyn in return; &ldquo;but instead of defending your companion, it
behoves you to defend yourself, for, as you had your part in the
destruction of the garden, I demand my forfeit equally of you, and your
left foot and right hand I must have. Stand on guard then! for I am a
match for twelve such as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words stung Theodoric to the quick. But with what celerity
soever he vaulted into the saddle, the moment had sufficed for Lareyn
to bind fast Wittich to a tree, and gain his stirrups in time to
confront his foe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I perceive you are the <i>Bern&auml;re</i>,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;by your shield and helm; and never have I poised lance so gladly
against any foe, and never have had such satisfaction in triumph as I
shall when I have you bound by the side of your companion, and when the
great Dietrich von Bern shall lie in the bonds of the little
Norg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dwarf! waste not words,&rdquo; cried Theodoric, in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>a terrible voice, his eyes flashing fire; his
spear trembling in his hand with the fury that burnt within him. Before
the foes could meet, however, and not a whit too soon, Hildebrand
appeared upon the scene, having found his way, with the bold Wolfhart
who never shrank from any fight, and Dietlieb the
<i>Steier&auml;re</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e1206src" href=
"#xd21e1206" name="xd21e1206src">29</a>, by the guidance of the injured
widow&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>Hastily Hildebrand reached Theodoric&rsquo;s ear: &ldquo;Fight him
not in that way,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he has ever the advantage with
the lance, and if he hurled you from the saddle, where would be your
princely honour? Never could you again reign in your Hall of Verona.
Dismount, and meet him on foot upon the grass, and watch for what
further may be suggested to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Theodoric gladly accepted the counsel of the sage, and, standing
once more on the ground, called to the Norg to meet him there. Lareyn
refused not, but met him with many a valiant thrust, which the wigand
parried, and returned too, as best he might, with Hildebrand&rsquo;s
counsel, till the little man complained of the interference, without
which, he swore, Dietrich had been bound even as Wittich. But Theodoric
bid him not talk, but fight, and with that planted him a blow between
the eyes which shut out the light of the sun. Hildebrand, meantime,
released Wittich, as it behoved while one fought in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>his
defence. But Lareyn, finding he could gain no signal advantage against
the hero, drew his <i>Tarnhaut</i> from his pocket, and, slipping it
over his head, became invisible to his antagonist. Now it was a weird
running hither and thither, as the deft Norg paid out his cunning
blows, and the bold wigand in vain sought him, that he might return
them; now his blow fell on the stone wall, and now on a tree, while the
Norg&rsquo;s mocking laughter echoed at each mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One counsel only I see,&rdquo; cried good Hildebrand,
distressed to see his prince so hard thrust; &ldquo;call to him to drop
his sword, and wrestle with you; so shall you reach him, and at least
know where he stands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hero followed the counsel of his master, nor did the Norg
refuse. True, Theodoric now could at least feel his unseen foe, but he
felt him to his cost, for it was impossible to stand against his
strength, nor was it long before the dwarf forced the hero down upon
his knees on the grass. Great was the wigand&rsquo;s distress, for
never had antagonist so dealt with him before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dietrich! beloved lord,&rdquo; cried Hildebrand, &ldquo;list
to my word. One way of safety there is: wrench from him his
girdle&mdash;his girdle which gives him twelve men&rsquo;s
strength!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladly Theodoric heard the counsel, nor was he long in finding with
his hand the girdle; by it he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href=
"#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>raised King Lareyn from the ground,
and dashed him down again, till the girdle burst and fell beneath their
feet. Hildebrand quickly caught it up, lest the dwarf should again
possess himself of it; but Lareyn gave a cry of despair which might
have been heard o&rsquo;er mountain and forest three days&rsquo;
journey off! Then, with doleful voice, he said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dietrich von Bern! if you are the noble sword for which men
hold you, you will be now content, and will give me my life; while I
will be your tributary, and mighty are the gifts I have to offer
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; replied Theodoric; &ldquo;your haughtiness and
pretensions have been too gross. I pardon not such as you so easily; we
must have another trial, in which you must yield up your worthless
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no power in fighting against such as he now, without
my girdle,&rdquo; mused the Norg; &ldquo;my only chance of safety lies
in getting one of the heroes who is equal to him to fight for my cause
in my place. So he made up to Dietlieb the <i>Steier&auml;re</i>, and
conjured him, as he was his brother-in-law, to help him in his
need&mdash;even as he loved his sister&rsquo;s honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True!&rdquo; replied Dietlieb; &ldquo;since you confess
honestly that you have my sister, it is meet that I should be your
champion; and I will deliver you or die.&rdquo; With that he went to
Theodoric, and prayed him earnestly four times, by his regard for
knightly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>honour, for woman&rsquo;s worth, for friendship,
and for virtue&mdash;four things which, at receiving his sword, every
knight bound himself to honour, that he would spare Lareyn. But
Theodoric was not to be moved, and each time only swore the harder that
he would fight it out to the last; that Lareyn had offended him too
deeply, and that he could not be suffered to live. When Dietlieb found
the ambassage he had undertaken unsuccessful, and that he would have to
own his failure, he grew impatient and wroth, and riding his horse up
to Theodoric, he proclaimed in a loud voice,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it known, Prince Dietrich, highly praised, that I declare
King Lareyn, great in power and riches, <i>shall not</i> be bound your
prisoner, nor his life taken; that I appear here to answer for him with
brotherly service, and that either he shall be let go scot free, or in
my person only shall the death-blow be dealt out for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Theodoric, unwilling to enter a feud of life and death with one of
his own allies, and yet too proud to refuse the challenge, answered him
nothing. But Dietlieb took the Norg and hid him away in safety in the
long grass out of Theodoric&rsquo;s sight, and then returned ready to
confront him. Theodoric, finding he was determined in his attack,
called for his horse, and bound on his helmet, his shield he took in
his hand, and hung his sword to his girdle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think not I spare you more than another, Lord <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>Theodoric, when I have found the cause I ought to
defend,&rdquo; cried Dietlieb, and his flashing eye told that he would
fight his fight to the end.</p>
<p>Theodoric still said no word, but his anger was the more
desperate.</p>
<p>Thus minded, they rode at each other, and the lance of each hurled
the other from his horse upon the grass. Up each sprang again, and drew
his trenchant sword; the one struck, and the other pierced, till the
grass all around, as high as their spurs, was dyed as red as the roses
they had destroyed anon. Then Theodoric dealt such a mighty stroke on
Dietlieb&rsquo;s helmet that the fire flashed again, and he thought,
&ldquo;Now have I conquered him and Lareyn at one blow.&rdquo; But
Dietlieb, recovering from the momentary shock, struck Theodoric&rsquo;s
shield with such force that he dashed it from his grasp; you might have
heard the clash a mile off!</p>
<p>When the bold Theodoric found he had his shield no longer, he took
his sword in both his hands, and gave the wigand such a mighty
<i>Schirmschlag</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e1261src" href=
"#xd21e1261" name="xd21e1261src">30</a> that he felled him to the
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, foolish man!&rdquo; he cried, in scorn, &ldquo;do
you still hold out for Lareyn?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span></p>
<p>Dietlieb sprang to his feet once more with a start which made his
armour ring again, and, for an answer, ran at Theodoric, and tried to
repeat his stroke; but Theodoric was more difficult to bring down, and
answered his attack by striking him on the rim of his shield so
forcibly that he loosed the band by which he held it.</p>
<p>Meantime, Hildebrand had been occupied stirring up the other wigands
to part the combatants, and at this moment Wittich and Wolfhart came up
to Dietlieb and seized him, and with main force dragged him off the
field; while Hildebrand reasoned with Theodoric about the merit and
friendship of Dietlieb, and the advantage of compromise now that he had
done enough to prove his superiority in the fight. Theodoric, who ever
gave weight to Hildebrand&rsquo;s reasoning, agreed to be friends again
with Dietlieb, and to leave Lareyn his life and liberty, only exacting
homage and tribute of him. To these terms Dietlieb also agreed, and all
entered the bonds of good friendship.</p>
<p>Lareyn, who had watched the combat and listened to the treaty of
peace from his hiding-place in the long grass, gave in his adhesion,
promising to pay tribute of all his wealth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, good brother-in-law,&rdquo; he said, addressing
Dietlieb, &ldquo;or brother-in-law that-is-to-be,&mdash;for Simild has
not yet given her consent to be my wife&mdash;let us talk a little
about your lovely sister. You <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href=
"#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>are doubtless burning to know how I
became possessed of her, and I no less to tell.&rdquo; Then he told him
how he had found her under the <i>linden</i>-tree, and had enveloped
her in the <i>Tarnhaut</i> and carried her away unseen by mortal eye;
and of how all Norgdom was subject to her, of how he had laid an empire
of boundless wealth at her feet, and how, if she preferred reigning on
earth, he was able to buy a vast kingdom to endow her with. Then he
noticed that the day was declining, and they far from shelter, and bade
them all welcome to his underground home, promising them good cheer and
merry pastime. Dietlieb, anxious to see his dear sister again, accepted
the offer, and the other wigands agreed to follow him. Stern Hildebrand
the Sage would have preferred camping in the open air, but Theodoric
told him it would be a shame on his name before all heroes if, having
been so near the Norg kingdom, of which all had heard, he should have
feared to make acquaintance with its economy and government. All the
others were of his mind, but Hildebrand reminded Theodoric, that as he
whom all were ready to obey had counselled incurring the danger, he
made himself responsible for all their lives. &ldquo;He who gave us
prudence will guard our lives and honour,&rdquo; said the prince; and
without further parley they rode on, after Lareyn&rsquo;s guidance.</p>
<p>On they rode, through thick forest and narrow mountain-path, till,
as it grew dark, they came to a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56"
href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>golden door in the rock. It
opened at Lareyn&rsquo;s approach, and the moment they had passed
within they found themselves surrounded by a light above the light of
day from the shining stones that glittered around. Trumpets sounded to
herald their entrance. As they advanced through the sparkling trees
friendly birds warbled a sweet welcome; and as they neared the hall
soft melodies of lutes and harps enchanted their ear. All around them
the Norgs disported themselves, ready to render any service the
wayfarers might require. Refreshment was all ready, as if they had been
expected; and when the wigands had done justice to the spread, they
were led each to his apartment to take their rest, which they well
needed.</p>
<p>In the morning Lareyn prayed them to stay and enjoy the wonders of
his kingdom and taste his hospitality, whereupon new debate arose.
Theodoric was disposed to trust him; and Dietlieb desirous to keep
friends with him for the sake of his sister; while Wolfhart was ready
for any sort of adventure; but Wittich, who had tasted the effects of
Lareyn&rsquo;s guile and strength, used all his persuasion to induce
the others to return, and prudent Hildebrand deemed it the wiser part.
At last, however, Wolfhart said, scornfully to Wittich, that if he was
afraid to stay he could go back; he had no need to spoil their
pleasure. After that Wittich said no more, but by his sullen looks he
showed he disapproved the venture. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57"
href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>Lareyn, seeing them doubtful, came up, and with much concern bid
them have no hesitation or fear, for all they saw was at their
service&mdash;they had but to command. To which Theodoric made answer
that such words were princely indeed, and if his deeds accorded
therewith he never would have reason to rue the league he had made with
them.</p>
<p>Then with delight Lareyn led them through the riches of his
possessions. So much heaped-up gold, so many precious stones, such
elaborate handiwork none of Theodoric&rsquo;s band had ever seen
before; and the place rang with their exclamations of wonder.</p>
<p>But all this was nothing to the cunning feats of the Norgs, who, at
a sign from Lareyn, displayed their various talents before the
astonished eyes of the heroes. Some there were who lifted great stones
bigger than themselves, and threw them as far as the eye could reach,
then by swiftness attained the goal before the stone they threw! Others
rooted up great pine-trees, and broke them across as sticks. Others did
feats of tilting and horsemanship, and others danced and leapt till the
knights were lost in wonder at their agility and strength.</p>
<p>Lareyn now called his guests in to dine; and all manner of costly
dishes were set before them, arranged with greater care and taste than
Theodoric was used to in his own palace, while sweet-voiced minstrels
sang, and nimble Norgs danced. In the midst of the repast, Simild,
summoned by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>Lareyn, entered the hall, attended by a train of
five hundred choicely-robed <i>Norginnen</i>; her own attire a very
wonder of art. It was all of silk and down, and set off with ornaments
of jewellery beyond compare with any on earth; stones there were of
value enough to ransom three kingdoms; and in her coronet one which
lighted up the hall with its radiance&mdash;meet crown of her own
loveliness! At Lareyn&rsquo;s courteously worded request she gave all
the guests a joyful welcome, with a word of praise from her rosy lips
for each, for their fame of knightly deeds. But when she saw Dietlieb
her joy knew no bounds; they embraced each other with the heartfelt joy
of those who have been long and cruelly separated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, sister mine,&rdquo; said Dietlieb, anxiously turning
to account the brief opportunity her embrace gave him of whispering
into her ear, &ldquo;is it of your own will that you are here, in this
strange mountain dwelling? is this Lareyn dear to you? and do you
desire to dwell with him? Or has his artifice been hateful to you? Say,
shall I rid you of his presence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother, it is your help I need to decide this thing,&rdquo;
replied the maid. &ldquo;Against Lareyn&rsquo;s mildness I have no word
to say: gift upon gift has been heaped upon me; with honour after
honour have I been endowed; and every wish of mine is fulfilled ere it
is born. But when I think of Him of whom <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>all our pleasures are the
bounty, I feel no pleasure in pleasures so bestowed. This pagan folk
holds Christ, our dear Lord, in hate&mdash;and when I think of Him, I
long to be again in Christendom<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1313src"
href="#xd21e1313" name="xd21e1313src">31</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Simild, sister dear, in Christendom is your place, not
here; and since such is your mind, cost what it will, I will set you
free from the Norg-king&rsquo;s power,&rdquo; was Dietlieb&rsquo;s
answer; and there was no time for more, for Lareyn called them back to
the fresh-dressed banquet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, new allies but trusted friends!&rdquo; cried the dwarf,
&ldquo;come, and let us be merry, and pledge our troth in the ruby
bowl! Lay aside your heavy arms and armour, your sword and shield. Let
us be light and free as brothers together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke a whole host of waiting-men appeared, who helped the
knights off with their armour, and brought them robes of rich stuffs
and costly work. The guests suffered them to do their will, for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>they were lost in admiration at the choice
banquet; at the table, all of ivory inlaid with devices of birds and
game so lifelike they seemed to skim across the board; at the vessels
of silver and gold and crystal of untiring variety of design; and,
above all, at the order and harmony with which all was directed.</p>
<p>Cool wine from cellars under earth was now served round<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1327src" href="#xd21e1327" name=
"xd21e1327src">32</a>; then various dishes in constant succession, each
rarer than the last; and then again sounded soft, clear voices to the
accompaniment of the harmonious strings. And again and again the
tankards were filled up with <i>Lautertrank</i>, <i>Moras</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1335src" href="#xd21e1335" name=
"xd21e1335src">33</a>, and wine.</p>
<p>At last the tables were drawn away, and at the same time Simild and
her maids withdrew; but many an hour more the guests sat while the
music and the singing continued to charm them. But lest even this
should weary, King Lareyn, as if determined there should be no end to
the change of pastimes with which he had undertaken to amuse his
guests, sent to fetch a certain conjuror who dwelt in the heart of a
high mountain, and whose arts surpassed any thing that had been done
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>before. The magician came at his bidding, and
exhibited surprising evidences of his craft, till at last the king
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a cunning man, no doubt, but there is one exhibition
of your power you have never been able to give me, and I shall think
nothing of your art till you can satisfy me. In this country within the
mountains, these jewels fixed in vault, wall, and sky, weary one with
their perpetual glare. Make them to move as the luminaries of earth, so
that we may have calm, peaceful night for repose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, O king! I have never before been able to accomplish
this desire,&rdquo; replied the magician; &ldquo;but now I have
acquired this art also, and waited for a fitting occasion to make the
first display of the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No occasion can be more fitting than the present,&rdquo;
answered Lareyn, &ldquo;when by its inauguration you shall celebrate
the visit of my honoured guests, and also by its achievement afford
them that rest from the glare of day to which they are accustomed in
their own nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I desire but to obey,&rdquo; replied the magician; and
forthwith he threw on to the fire that burnt on a black stone before
him, a powder which no sooner touched the flame than a pale blue smoke
arose with pleasing scent, and, curling through the hall, presently
extinguished the brilliant shining of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>every countless jewel
with which the walls and roof were set.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if you are master of your art,&rdquo; continued the
king, &ldquo;let us have light once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magician, wrapt in his incantation, spoke not, but dropped
another powder on the flame, which at once sent up a wreathing fume of
rainbow hues, carrying back to every precious stone its lustre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wondrous!&rdquo; &ldquo;Brave artist!&rdquo; &ldquo;Wondrous
show indeed!&rdquo; were the exclamations which broke spontaneously
from every lip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let it be dark again,&rdquo; said the king; and the
magician quenched the sparkling light as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now light,&rdquo; he cried; and so alternated until the sight
was no longer new. Now, it was dark, and this time Lareyn called no
more for light, nor spoke, and the silence was long; till the heroes
grew anxious, and Wittich turned to where Wolfhart had sat, and said,
&ldquo;I like not this: who knows but that while we can see naught the
Norgs may fall upon us and destroy us?&rdquo; But Wolfhart answered
not, for a stupor had fallen upon him that the fumes had been gifted to
convey; and Wittich, too, felt their influence before he could utter
another word; so it was with Hildebrand the Sage no less. Theodoric
only had time to answer, &ldquo;Such treachery were not princely; and
if Lareyn means harm to us, he may be sure he will rue this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>day,&rdquo; and then sleep fell upon him as on the
others.</p>
<p>Dietlieb had already left the hall, thinking under cover of the
darkness to find his sister, but being met by a page had been conducted
to his apartment, and knew nothing of what had befallen the others.</p>
<p>Lareyn, meanwhile, sought out Simild in anxious mood. &ldquo;Ever
lovely virgin!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;support me with your prudent
counsel in this strait. I have already told you how your people have
avenged on me that I have loved you; how they have laid low my silken
fence and golden gates, and wasted my choice garden of roses. Good
reprisals I had thought to have taken, and had I been left man to man
against them I had overcome them all; but Hildebrand the Sage
interposed his advice: it was thus the <i>Bern&auml;re</i> had the
advantage over me, and had it not been for your brother
Dietlieb&rsquo;s stout defence, he had even taken my life. But in all
the other four beside him there is no good, and in one way or another I
had found means to rid me of them, but for Dietlieb&rsquo;s sake, who
would be as ready to oppose me in their defence as he opposed Dietrich
in mine. So, fair lady mine, say how shall I end this
affair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you would follow my advice,&rdquo; replied Simild,
&ldquo;be not rash; and, above all, use no treachery; keep to the pact
of peace that you have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64"
name="pb64">64</a>]</span>sworn; and be sure the Christian knights will
not go back from their plighted word. But in place of the little girdle
of twelve-men&rsquo;s-strength that they took from you, here is a ring
of equal power which your seven magicians welded for me: with that you
will feel all your old consciousness of strength and dignity. But, by
all you hold dear, let the wigands go forth with honour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lareyn was not slow to own that the counsel was good, and spoke as
if he would have followed it. But when he put on the ring, and found
himself endowed once more with twelve men&rsquo;s strength, he could
not forbear taking his sweet revenge for his yesterday&rsquo;s defeat
and danger.</p>
<p>First, he had sevenfold bolts put on Dietlieb&rsquo;s door, that he
might not be able to come forth and aid his brethren; and then he sent
and called for one of the giants, who were always true allies to the
dwarfs, and entreated him to carry the heroes to a deep dungeon below
the roots of the mountains, where they should be bound, and shut out
from the light of day, and never again be able to do him harm.</p>
<p>The feat pleased the giant well; and, having bound a cord round the
waist of each of the sleeping heroes, slung the four over his shoulder
as if they had been no heavier than sparrows, and carried them to the
dungeon below the roots of the mountains, whither Lareyn led the way,
now <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>skipping, now dancing, now singing, now laughing
in high glee, to think how well he had succeeded in ridding him of his
foes&mdash;but forgetting all about Simild&rsquo;s advice, and his
promise to her.</p>
<p>It was not till next morning that the heroes woke; and then all was
cold and dark around them, and they knew they were no longer in the
hall of the banquet, for the iron chains and stanchions, the chill, and
must, and damp, and slime, told them they were in a dungeon under
earth.</p>
<p>Loudly they all exclaimed against the deceit with which they had
been caught, and loudly they all swore to find means to punish the
treacherous captor. But Theodoric&rsquo;s anger was greater than the
anger of them all; and the fiery breath<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1393src" href="#xd21e1393" name="xd21e1393src">34</a> glowed so
hot within him that it scorched away the bonds with which he was
bound!</p>
<p>Once more, then, his hands at least were free, and his companions
gave him joy; but his feet were still held to the rock by chains of
hard steel, the links as thick as a man&rsquo;s arm. Nevertheless, his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>indignation was so great that when he beat them
with his fists they were obliged to yield, as they had been made of
egg-shell; and when he had broken his own chains he set to work and
released the others also.</p>
<p>Great was their joy and thankfulness; but heaviness came down on
them again when they saw themselves closed in by the cruel rock, and
all their armour and weapons of defence locked up far away from them in
the Norg&rsquo;s castle. Another day they lay there in despair, and
another, for wise Hildebrand saw no way of passing through the
rock<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1416src" href="#xd21e1416" name=
"xd21e1416src">35</a>.</p>
<p>Meantime Simild had grown uneasy at the silence that reigned in the
palace; there was no more sound of revel and festivity, and of
entertaining guests. She was no more sent for to entertain them, and
Lareyn hid himself from her, and avoided her. In dire fear she hunted
out the right key of her brother&rsquo;s apartment, and having covered
the glowing carbuncle in her coronet, which lighted up every place,
crept along silently till she had reached him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister mine!&rdquo; exclaimed Dietlieb, &ldquo;what does this
mean? why am I held fast by seven locks? and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>why do
no tidings of my companions reach me? Oh! had I but my sword and
shield, I would release them from the hands of Lareyn, and of how many
Norgs soever he may have at his command! or at least I would not
survive to bear the shame of living while they are in I know not what
plight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dietlieb, be guided by me,&rdquo; replied the maiden:
&ldquo;we must deliver them out of the dire dungeon in which Lareyn has
treacherously confined them, but also we must have your life and honour
safe. Take this ring upon your hand, for against him who wears it none
can prevail; and then go and deliver your companions.&rdquo; With that
she took him along to where his armour lay concealed; and having girt
him with it, she said many a fervent blessing<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1428src" href="#xd21e1428" name="xd21e1428src">36</a> over him,
to preserve him from harm.</p>
<p>Endowed with the strength the ring gave him, Dietlieb was able to
load himself with the arms and armour of all the four heroes; and at
its command a way was made in the rock, through which he passed it in
to them. As each piece fell upon the hard floor, the clang re-echoed
through the far-off mountains.</p>
<p>Lareyn heard the noise, and knew what had befallen, so he sounded on
his horn the note that was known far and wide through all the lands of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>the Norgs; and at the call three hundred thousand
dwarfs appeared swarming over the whole face of the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me, my men! to me!&rdquo; cried Lareyn, as they drew near.
&ldquo;Before you stands he who has essayed to release our enemies whom
I and the giant had bound under the roots of the mountains. He has
given them back their strong armour and their weapons of war, and if
they get loose and come among us, great havoc will they make of us,
therefore smite him down and destroy him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dwarfs rushed on Dietlieb at the bidding of the king; but Lareyn
would not engage him himself, because he had fought for his release.
Dietlieb, young and strong, stood planted against a vault of the rock,
and as the mannikins approached him, he showered his blows upon them,
and sent them sprawling, till the dead and mangled were piled up
knee-deep around him.</p>
<p>The heroes heard the sound of the battle in their prison, and they
longed to take their part in the fray; but they saw no means of
breaking through the rock to reach him, till Hildebrand bethought him
that he had yet with him the girdle he had picked up when Theodoric
tore it from the Norg-king&rsquo;s body. This he now handed to the
hero.</p>
<p>Theodoric took it, and spoke not for joy, but with its strength tore
down the living rock round the opening Dietlieb&rsquo;s ring had made,
and burst his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>way to stand beside the brave young <i lang=
"de">Steier&auml;re</i>. This done, scorning the girdle&rsquo;s
strength, he cast it back to Hildebrand, trusting in his good sword
alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, treacherous dwarf, come on!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;No
knightly troth has bound you, but against us, your guests and allies,
you have acted as one who has no right to live! Come here, and let me
give you the guerdon you have earned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lareyn refused not; and the two fought with fury terrible to behold.
And yet Theodoric prevailed not. Then Hildebrand discerned the ring of
twelve-men&rsquo;s-strength on Lareyn&rsquo;s hand, where it was not
before, and knew it was a talisman, so he called to Theodoric, and
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dietrich, my prince, seize yonder ring upon the
Norg-king&rsquo;s hand! so shall his strength be no more increased by
the powers of his magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Theodoric, ever prone to be guided by the advice of the Sage,
directed a mighty blow upon the ring, so that the hoop must fain give
way; and the dwarf&rsquo;s power went from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now all your hosts, and all your arts, and all your gold
shall profit you nothing more!&rdquo; So cried the <i>Bern&auml;re</i>;
&ldquo;but condign penalties you must suffer for your crime. My
prisoner you are, nor is there any can deliver you more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Norgs, grieving for their king&rsquo;s loss, trooped round
Theodoric and attacked him on every side; but he swang his good sword
Velsungen around, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70"
name="pb70">70</a>]</span>and at every sweep a hundred Norg&rsquo;s
heads fell pattering at his feet. Suddenly a little dwarf came running
out from the mountain rock, and seizing Lareyn&rsquo;s horn, blew on it
notes which wandered wild through all the forest-trees.</p>
<p>Five giants lived in the forest, and when they heard those notes
they knew the Norgs were in dire distress. With swift strides they
came; their helmets flashed like lightning over the tops of the pines;
and each brought his sword and pike of trenchant steel. The little
dwarf saw his brethren mown down like grass before the scythe, and
again sent forth his far-sounding notes of distress. The giants heard
it, and marched over hill and dale, till they came before the
mountain-side. Again the little dwarf sent out his appeal, and the
giants burst their way through the mountain; but albeit they came with
such speed, twelve thousand Norgs were meantime lost to King Lareyn by
Velsungen&rsquo;s strokes.</p>
<p>Dietlieb and Hildebrand, Wittich and Wolfhart mowed down their
harvest too.</p>
<p>Now they had to prepare for another kind of attack, for in fearful
array the five giants came down upon them, brandishing their clubs of
steel. But neither could these stand before the swords of the heroes,
and each several one laid low his adversary.</p>
<p>When the Norgs saw that their king was bound, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>and
their best fighting-men destroyed, and the giants themselves without
breath, they knew they could stand no longer before the wigands, but
each turned him and fled for refuge to the mountains.</p>
<p>The heroes then, seeing no more left to slay, went into the
banquet-hall, where only Simild stood, for all the Norgs had hidden
themselves in fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, noble brother! and welcome, bold swords all!&rdquo;
cried the maid; &ldquo;you have delivered us from this treacherous
king. Now you will go home to your own land with glory and honour, and
take me with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heroes returned her greeting, and rejoiced in her praise; then
they piled up the treasure on to waggons, all they could carry, and in
triumph they made their way to earth, and Lareyn with them, bound.</p>
<p>First they directed their steps to Styria, till they came to the
spreading linden-tree whence Simild had first been taken; for there sat
Duke Biterolf, her father, bewailing his bereavement, and around him
trooped her maidens lamenting their companion.</p>
<p>All was restored to joy and gladness now that Simild was at home
again. They passed seven days in high festival, the heroes all
together; and many a time they had to tell the tale of their bold
deeds, and the wonders of the mountain-world. And the minstrels sang to
the merits of the conquerors, while the merry bowl passed round and
round. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span></p>
<p>At last Theodoric rose and thanked Biterolf for his hospitality, who
thanked him in return right heartily for the help he had lent his son.
With that Theodoric took his leave, and along with him went Hildebrand
the Sage, and Wittich the Wigand, and the strong Wolfhart, and King
Lareyn too, of whom Theodoric made his court-fool in his palace at
Verona. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=

R&Ouml;HRERB&Uuml;CHEL.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">From the fourteenth to the sixteenth, in some few
places down to the seventeenth, centuries the mountains of Tirol were
in many localities profitably worked in the search after the precious
metals; many families were enriched; and the skill of the Tirolese
miners passed into a proverb throughout Europe. When the veins lying
near the surface had been worked out, the difficulty of bringing the
machinery required for deeper workings into use, in a country whose
soil has nowhere three square miles of plain, rendered the further
pursuit so expensive that it was in great measure abandoned, though
some iron and copper is still got out. There are many old shafts
entirely deserted, and their long and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>intricate passages into
the bowels of the earth not only afford curious places of excursion to
the tourist, but are replete with fantastic memories of their earlier
destination.</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable of these is the so-called
R&ouml;hrerb&uuml;chel, which is situated between Kitzb&uuml;hl and St.
Johann, and not far from the latter place. It was one of the most
productive and one of the latest worked, and it boasted of having the
deepest shaft that had ever been sunk in Europe; but for above a
hundred and fifty years it has been <i>taub</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1507src" href="#xd21e1507" name="xd21e1507src">38</a>, that is,
<i>deaf</i>, to the sound of the pick and the hammer and the voices of
the Knappen<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1516src" href="#xd21e1516" name=
"xd21e1516src">39</a>.</p>
<p>I have given you <i>my</i> way of accounting for the cessation of
the mining-works. The people have another explanation. They say that
the Bergm&auml;nnlein, or little men of the mountains&mdash;the dwarfs
who were the presiding guardians of these mineral treasures&mdash;were
so disgusted with the avarice with which the people seized upon their
stores, that they refused to lend them their help any more, and that
without their guidance the miners were no longer able to carry on their
search aright, and the gnomes took themselves off to other
countries.</p>
<p>One of these little men of the mountains, however, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>there
was in the R&ouml;hrerb&uuml;chle who loved his ancient house too well
to go forth to seek another; he still lingered about the mile-long
clefts and passages which once had been rich with ore, and often the
peasants heard him bewailing, and singing melancholy ditties, over his
lonely fate. They even thought he came out sometimes to watch them
sadly in their companionship of labour, and peeped through their
windows at them in their cosy cottages, while it was cold and dark
where he stood without: and many there were who took an interest in the
<i>Nickel of the R&ouml;hrerb&uuml;chel</i>.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The Goigner J&ouml;ssl<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1535src" href=
"#xd21e1535" name="xd21e1535src">40</a> had been mowing the grassy
slope near the opening of the R&ouml;hrerb&uuml;chl; he was just
putting up his implements to carry home after his day&rsquo;s toil,
when he espied the orphan Aennerl<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1538src"
href="#xd21e1538" name="xd21e1538src">41</a> coming towards him. Her
dark eyes had met his before that day, and he never met her glance
without a thrill of joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been over to Oberndorf for a day&rsquo;s work,&rdquo;
said orphan Aennerl, &ldquo;and as I came back I thought I would turn
aside this way, and see how you were getting on; and then we can go
home together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we will,&rdquo; answered J&ouml;ssl; &ldquo;but
we&rsquo;re both <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>tired, and the sun isn&rsquo;t gone
yet&mdash;let&rsquo;s sit down and have a bit of talk before we
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Orphan Aennerl was nothing loath; and they sat and talked of the
events of the day, and their companions, and their work, and the
weather, and the prospects of the morrow. But both seemed to feel there
was something else to be said, and they sat on, as not knowing how to
begin.</p>
<p>At last J&ouml;ssl removed his pointed hat from his head and laid it
by his side, and took out and replaced the jaunty feathers which
testified his prowess in the holiday sport<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1551src" href="#xd21e1551" name="xd21e1551src">42</a>, and
finally cleared his throat to say, softly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this not happiness, Aennerl?&mdash;what can we want more
in this world? True, we work hard all day, but is not our toil repaid
when we sit together thus, while the warm evening sun shines round us,
and the blue heaven above and the green fields below smile on us, and
we are <i>together</i>? Aennerl, shall we not be <i>always</i> happy
together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were the very words that orphan Aennerl had so often longed to
hear her J&ouml;ssl say. Something like them she had repeated to
herself again <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>and again, and wondered if the happy day would
ever come when she should hear them from his own lips. Had he said them
to her any day of her whole life before, how warmly would she have
responded to them!</p>
<p>To-day, however, it was different. The rich peasant&rsquo;s wife for
whom the poor orphan worked had been harsh to her that day, and for the
first time envious thoughts had found entrance into her mind, and
discontent at her lowly lot.</p>
<p>So, instead of assenting warmly, she only said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s very nice, J&ouml;ssl, but then
it&rsquo;s only for a little bit, you see. The hard toil lasts all day,
nevertheless. Now to have a Hof<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1573src"
href="#xd21e1573" name="xd21e1573src">43</a> of one&rsquo;s own, like
the one I work upon at Oberndorf, with plenty of cattle, and corn, and
servants to work for you, <i>that&rsquo;s</i> what <i>I</i> should call
being happy! Sitting together in the sunset is all very well, but we
might have that besides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good, hard-working, thrifty, God-fearing J&ouml;ssl looked
aghast to hear his Aennerl speak so. Beyond his day&rsquo;s wage
honestly worked for, and the feather in his <i>Trutzhut</i> bravely
contended for, and his beloved Aennerl wooed with tenderness and
constancy&mdash;he had not a thought or a wish in the wide world.
Hitherto her views had been the counterpart of his; now, for the first
time, he perceived <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78"
name="pb78">78</a>]</span>there was something had come between them,
and he felt disappointed and estranged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If <i>that&rsquo;s</i> your view, Aennerl girl, it
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1596" title=
"Source: is&rsquo;nt">isn&rsquo;t</span> the Goigner J&ouml;ssl that
will be able to make you happy,&rdquo; replied the youth at length,
coldly; &ldquo;your best chance would be with the Nickel of the
R&ouml;hrerb&uuml;chel,&rdquo; he added, almost bitterly, as one who
would say, Your case is desperate; you have no chance at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; said Aennerl, suddenly starting.
&ldquo;Who can be working so late? Don&rsquo;t you hear a pick go
&lsquo;click, clack&rsquo;? Who can it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one is working at this hour,&rdquo; replied J&ouml;ssl, in
no mood to be pleased at the interruption. But as he spoke the bells of
the villages around toned forth the <i>Ave-Maria</i>. Both folded their
hands devoutly for the evening prayer; and in the still silence that
ensued he could not deny that he heard the sound of the pick vigorously
at work, and that, as it seemed, under the ground directly beneath
their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the Bergm&auml;nnlein&mdash;it <i>must be</i> the
Bergm&auml;nnlein himself!&rdquo; exclaimed Aennerl, with
excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! what silly tales are you thinking of?&rdquo;
replied J&ouml;ssl, inwardly reproaching himself for the light words he
had just spoken suggesting the invocation of a superstition with which
his honest, devout nature felt no sympathy; and, without <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>letting
the excited girl exert herself to catch the strange sounds further, he
led her home.</p>
<p>Aennerl&rsquo;s curiosity was roused, however, and was not to be so
easily laid to rest.</p>
<p>The next evening J&ouml;ssl&rsquo;s work lay in a different
direction, but no sooner had the hour of the evening rest arrived than
he started on the road to Oberndorf, to see if he could meet his
Aennerl coming home. But there was no Aennerl on the path; and he
turned homewards with a heavy heart, fearing lest he had offended her,
and that she was shunning him.</p>
<p>But Aennerl, whom the desire of being rich had overcome with all the
force of a new passion, had been more absorbed on that last memorable
evening by the idea of having heard the Bergm&auml;nnlein at work amid
the riches of the mines than with&mdash;what would have been so
terrible a grief at any other time&mdash;having offended her faithful
J&ouml;ssl. Accordingly, on the next evening, instead of being on the
look-out for J&ouml;ssl to walk home with her, her one thought had been
to find out the same place on the bank where they had sat&mdash;not
with loving affection to recall the happy words she had heard there,
but to listen for the sound of the Bergm&auml;nnl&rsquo;s axe, and
perhaps follow it out; and then&mdash;and then&mdash;who could tell
<i>what</i> might befall? Perhaps she might be able to obtain some
chips of those vast wealth-stores unperceived; perhaps the
Bergm&auml;nnl&rsquo;s heart might be opened to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>her&mdash;who could say but, in some mode or
other, it might be the way to fortune?</p>
<p>She was not long in tracing out the spot, for she had marked the
angle which the well-known outline of the mighty Sonnengebirg bore to
the jagged &ldquo;comb<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1629src" href=
"#xd21e1629" name="xd21e1629src">44</a>&rdquo; of the Kitzbichler-Horn,
and for a nearer token, there lay, just before her, the crushed
wild-flower which her J&ouml;ssl had twisted and torn in his
nervousness as he had brought himself to speak to her for the first
time of their future. But she thought not of all that at that time; she
was only concerned to find the spot, and to listen for the stroke of
the Nickel&rsquo;s pickaxe. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; that was it again, sure
enough! She lingers not on that happy bank; she stops not to pick up
one of those wild-flower tokens: &lsquo;click, clack,&rsquo; goes the
axe, and that is the sound to guide her steps. The village bells sound
the <i>Ave-Maria</i>, but the sacred notes arrest her not&mdash;the
evening prayer is forgotten in the thirst for gold.</p>
<p>But J&ouml;ssl heard the holy sound as he was retracing his steps
mournfully from his fruitless search after her, having missed her by
but a minute&rsquo;s interval. He heard it as he was passing a little
old, old wayside chapel, which you may yet see, with a lordly pine-tree
overshadowing it, and which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href=
"#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>records the melancholy fate of some
Knappen who perished in the underground workings. J&ouml;ssl, who has
no fear on the steep mountain-side, and loves to hang dangerously
between earth and sky when he is out after the chamois, shudders when
he thinks of those long, dark, mysterious passages where the miners
worked underground, and, as he kneels on the stone step of that wayside
memorial, obedient to the village-bell, involuntarily applies his
prayer to all those who have to penetrate those strange recesses:
&ldquo;Be with them; help them now and in the hour of death.
Amen.&rdquo; If you had told him his Aennerl was included in that
prayer he would not have believed you then.</p>
<p>Meantime Aennerl had found her way to the opening of the old mine.
It has a lateral shaft through which you may walk some distance&mdash;a
very long way it seemed to Aennerl, now breathless and trembling, but
the nearing sounds of the Bergm&auml;nnl&rsquo;s tool kept up her
courage, and determined her not to give in till she had attained the
goal.</p>
<p>On she went, groping her way with fear and trembling, and expecting
every moment to come upon some terrible sight. But, far from this, in
proportion as she got deeper into the intricate passages of the
R&ouml;hrerb&uuml;chel, the way, instead of getting darker, grew
lighter and lighter. A pale, clear, rosy light played on the sides of
the working, which, now that she looked at them close, she <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>found to
her astonishment were not made of rough, yellow clay, as she had
thought hitherto, but of pure, sparkling gold, and encrusted with
gems!</p>
<p>It was no longer fear that palsied her, it was a fascination of
delight at finding herself in the midst of those riches she coveted,
but the near approach of which brought back misgivings of the danger of
their possession of which she had so often heard, though without ever
previously feeling an application to herself in the warning.</p>
<p>Her curiosity far too strongly stimulated to yield to the counsel of
her conscience to turn and flee the temptation, she walked stealthily
on and on, till the faint, rosy light grew into a red, radiant glow,
which, as she reached its focus, quite dazzled her senses.</p>
<p>She now found herself in a broad and lofty clearing, into which the
long narrow passage she had so long been timorously pursuing ran, and
in the sides of which she saw the openings of many other similar
ramifications. The walls, which arched it in overhead and closed it
from the daylight, were of gold and silver curiously intermixed,
burnished resplendently, and their brilliance so overcame her that it
was some minutes before she could recover her sight to examine more
particularly the details of this magnificent abode.</p>
<p>Then she discovered that all this blaze of light <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>came
from one huge carbuncle<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1658src" href=
"#xd21e1658" name="xd21e1658src">45</a>, and that carbuncle was set in
the breast-bib of the leathern apron worn by a <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1661" title="Source: drawf">dwarf</span>, the clang of whose
pickaxe had lured her to the uncanny spot.</p>
<p>The dwarf was much too busily and too noisily engaged to notice
Aennerl&rsquo;s footsteps, so she had plenty of leisure to examine him.
He was a little awkward-shaped fellow, nearly as broad as he was long,
with brawny muscular arms which enabled him to wield his pick with
tremendous effect. He seemed, however, to be wielding it merely for
exercise or sport, for there did not appear to be any particular
advantage to be gained from his work, which only consisted in chipping
up a huge block of gold, and there were heaps on heaps of such chips
already lying about. Though his muscles displayed so much strength,
however, his face gave you the idea of a miserable, worn-out old man;
his cheeks were wrinkled and furrowed and bronzed; and the matted hair
of his head and beard was snowy white. As he worked he sang, in dull,
low, unmelodious chant, to which his pick beat time,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The weary Bergm&auml;nnl, old and grey,</p>
<p class="line">Sits alone in a cleft of the earth for aye,</p>

<p class="line">For a thousand years, and ten thousand more,</p>
<p class="line">He has guarded earth&rsquo;s precious silver store,</p>

</div>
<p class="first">He had poured out his ditty many times over while
Aennerl stood gazing at the strange and gorgeous scene. The ugly,
misshapen, miserable old man seemed altogether out of place amid the
glories of the wonderful treasure-house; and the glittering treasures
themselves in turn seemed misplaced in this remote subterranean
retreat. Aennerl was quite puzzled how to make it all out. It was the
Nickel of the R&ouml;hrerb&uuml;chel who was before her, she had no
doubt of <i>that</i>, for he was exactly what the tradition of the
people had always described him, and she had heard his ungainly form
described before she could speak; so familiar he seemed, indeed, from
those many descriptions, that it took away great part of the fear
natural to finding herself in so novel a situation.</p>
<p>At last the dwarf suddenly stopped his labour, and, as if in very
weariness, flung the tool he had been using far from him, so that it
fell upon a heap of gold chips near which Aennerl was standing,
scattering <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>them in all directions. One of the sharp bits of
ore hit her rudely on the chin, and, anxious as she was to escape
observation, she could not suppress a little cry of pain.</p>
<p>Old and withered and haggard as he seemed, the Cobbold&rsquo;s eye
glittered with a light only second to that of the Karfunkelstein itself
at the sound of a maiden&rsquo;s voice, and quickly he turned to seize
her. Aennerl turned and fled, but the Nickel, throwing his leathern
apron over the shining stone on his breast, plunged the whole place in
darkness, and Aennerl soon lost her footing among the unevennesses of
the way and lay helpless on the ground. Her pursuer, to whom every
winding had been as familiar as the way to his pocket these thousand
years, was by her side in a trice, still singing, as he came
along,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;But never a friend to say, &lsquo;Good
day,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="line">As he sits in a cleft of the earth for aye,</p>
<p class="line">Has the lonely Bergm&auml;nnl, old and grey!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The self-pitying words, and the melancholy tone in
which they were uttered, changed most of Aennerl&rsquo;s alarm into
compassion; and when the dwarf uncovered the carbuncle again, and the
bright, warm red light played once more around them, and showed up the
masses of gold after which she had so longed, she began to feel almost
at home, so that when the dwarf asked her who she was and what had
brought <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>her there, she answered him quite naturally, and
told him all her story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth,&rdquo; said the Cobbold, when she had
finished, &ldquo;I am pretty well tired of having all this to myself. I
was very angry at one time, it is true, with the way in which your
fellows went to work destroying and carrying every thing away, and
leaving nothing for those that are to come after, and I was determined
to put a stop to it. I am not here to look after <i>one</i> generation,
or <i>two</i>, or <i>three</i>, but for the whole lot of you in all the
ages of the world, and I must keep things in some order. But now they
have given this place up and left me alone, I confess I feel not a
little sorry. I used to like to listen to their busy noises, and their
songs, and the tramp of their feet. So, if you&rsquo;ve a mind to make
up for it, and come and sit with me for a bit now and then, and sing to
me some of the lively songs you have in your world up there, I
don&rsquo;t say I won&rsquo;t give you a lapful of gold now and
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A lapful of gold! what peasant girl would mind sitting for a bit now
and then, and singing to a poor lonely old fellow, to be rewarded with
a lapful of gold? Certainly not Aennerl! Too delighted to speak, she
only beamed assent with her dark, flashing eyes, and clapped her hands
and laughed for joy.</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s many a day since these walls have echoed a sound
like that,&rdquo; said the dwarf, with deep feeling, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>and as
Aennerl&rsquo;s smile rested on him, it seemed to wipe away some of the
rough dark wrinkles that furrowed his cheeks and relax the tension of
his knit brows. &ldquo;And yet there&rsquo;s more worth in those echoes
than in all the metallic riches which resound to them! Yes, my lass,
only come and see the poor old Bergm&auml;nnl sometimes, and cheer him
a bit, and you shall have what you will of his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he led her gently back into the great vault where she had
first seen him working, and, stirring up a heap with his foot,
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, lass, there&rsquo;s the Bergm&auml;nnl&rsquo;s store;
take what you will&mdash;it is not the Bergm&auml;nnl that would say
nay to a comely wench like you. Why, if I were younger, and a
better-looking fellow, it would not be my lapfuls of gold I should
offer you, it would be the whole lot of it&mdash;and myself to boot!
No, no, I shouldn&rsquo;t let you go from me again: such a pretty bird
does not come on to the snare to be let fly again, I promise you! But
I&rsquo;m old and grey, and my hoary beard is no match for your dainty
cheeks. But take what you will, take what you will&mdash;only come and
cheer up the poor old Bergm&auml;nnl a bit sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aennerl had not wanted to be told twice. Already she had filled her
large pouch and her apron and her kerchief with all the alacrity of
greed. So much occupied was she with stowing away the greatest possible
amount of the spoil, that she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href=
"#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>scarcely remembered to thank the
Bergm&auml;nnl, who, however, found pleasure enough in observing the
rapturous gestures her good fortune elicited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come again?&rdquo; said the Cobbold, as he saw
her turn to go when she had settled her burden in such a way that its
weight should least impede her walking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, never fear, I&rsquo;ll come again! When shall I
come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, when you will! Let&rsquo;s see, to-day&rsquo;s Saturday,
isn&rsquo;t it? Well, next Saturday, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till next Saturday, then, good-bye!&rdquo; said Aennerl,
panting only to turn her gold to account; and so full was she of
calculation of what she would do with it, that she never noticed the
poor old dwarf was coming behind her to light her, and singing, as he
went,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The weary Bergm&auml;nnl, old and grey,</p>
<p class="line xd21e1688">Sits alone in a cleft of the earth for

<p class="line xd21e1688">With never a friend to say, &lsquo;Good

</div>
<p class="first">Aennerl had no time for pity; she was wholly absorbed
in the calculation of the grand things she <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>could
now buy, the fine dresses she would be able to wear, and in rehearsing
the harsh speeches of command with which she would let fling at the
girls whom she would take into her service, and who yesterday were the
companions-in-labour of orphan Aennerl.</p>
<p>The village was all wrapt in silence and sleep as Aennerl got back
with her treasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So late, and so laden! poor child!&rdquo; said the parish
priest, as he came out of a large old house into the lane, and met her.
&ldquo;I have been commending to God the soul of our worthy neighbour
Bartl. He was open-handed in his charity, and the poor will miss a
friend; he gave us a good example while he lived&mdash;Aennerl, my
child, <i lang="de">bet&rsquo; f&uuml;r ihn</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1794src" href="#xd21e1794" name="xd21e1794src">47</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aennerl scarcely returned his greeting, nor found one word of sorrow
to lament the loss of the good old Bartl; for one thought had taken
possession of her mind at first hearing of his death. Old Bartl had a
fine homestead, and one in which all was in good order; but Bartl was
alone in the world, there was no heir to enter on his goods: it was
well known that he had left all to the hospital, and the place would be
sold. What a chance for Aennerl! There was no homestead in the whole
<span lang="de">Gebiet</span><a class="noteref" id="xd21e1801src" href=
"#xd21e1801" name="xd21e1801src">48</a> in such good order, or so well
worth having, as the Hof of old Bartl.</p>
<p>Aennerl already reckoned it as hers, and in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>meantime
kept an eye open for any chances of good stock that might come into the
market.</p>
<p>Nor were chances wanting. The illness which had carried old Bartl to
the grave had been caught at the bedside of the Wilder
J&uuml;rgl<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1811src" href="#xd21e1811" name=
"xd21e1811src">49</a>. A fine young man he had been indeed, but the
villagers had not called him &ldquo;Wild&rdquo; without reason; and
because he had loved all sorts of games, and a gossip in the tavern,
and a dance with the village maids more than work, all he had was in
confusion. He always said he was young, and he would set all straight
by-and-by, there was plenty of time. But death cut him off, young as he
was; and his widow found herself next morning alone in the world, with
three sturdy boys to provide for, all too young to earn a crust, and
all J&uuml;rgl&rsquo;s debts to meet into the bargain. There was no
help for it: the three fine cows which were the envy of the village,
and which had been her portion at her father&rsquo;s death, only six
months before, must be sold.</p>
<p>Aennerl was the purchaser. Once conscience reproached her with a
memory of the days long gone by, when she and that young widow were
playmates, when orphan Aennerl had been taken home from her
mother&rsquo;s grave by that same widow&rsquo;s father, and the two
children had grown up in confidence and affection with each other.
&ldquo;Suppose I left her the cows and the money too?&rdquo; mused
Aennerl<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>&mdash;but only for a moment. No; had they been
any other cows, it might have been different&mdash;but just those three
which all the village praised! one which had carried off the prize and
the garland of roses at the last cow-fight<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1818src" href="#xd21e1818" name="xd21e1818src">50</a>, and the
others were only next in rank. <i>That</i> was a purchase not to be
thrown away. Still she was dissatisfied with herself, and inclined to
sift her own mind further, when she was distracted by the approach of
loud tramping steps, as of one carrying a burden.</p>
<p>It was the Langer Peterl; and a goodly burden he bore,
indeed&mdash;a burden which was sure to gather round him all the people
of Reith, or any other place through which he might pass.</p>
<p>Aennerl laughed and clapped her hands. &ldquo;Oh, Peterl, you come
<i lang="de">erw&uuml;nscht</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e1830src"
href="#xd21e1830" name="xd21e1830src">51</a>!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Show me what you have got to sell&mdash;show me all your pretty
things! I want an entirely new rig-out. Make haste! show me the
best&mdash;the very best&mdash;you have brought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show <i>you</i> the <i>best</i>, indeed!&rdquo; said the
Langer Peterl, scarcely slackening his pace, and not removing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>the pipe from his mouth; for hitherto he had only
known the orphan Aennerl by her <i>not</i> being one of his customers.
&ldquo;Show <i>you</i> the best, indeed, that what you can&rsquo;t buy
you may amuse yourself with a sight of! And when you&rsquo;ve soiled it
all with your greasy fingers, who&rsquo;ll buy it, d&rsquo;you suppose?
A likely matter, indeed! Show you the best! ha! ha! ha! you don&rsquo;t
come over me like that, though you <i>have</i> got a pair of dark eyes
which look through into a fellow&rsquo;s marrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Peterl!&rdquo; replied Aennerl, too delighted with
the thought of the finery in prospect even to resent the taunt;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to look at it merely&mdash;not I, I can tell
you! I want to buy it&mdash;buy it all up&mdash;and pay you your own
price! Here, look here, does <i>this</i> please you?&rdquo; and she
showed him a store of gold such as in all his travels he had never seen
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if <i>that&rsquo;s</i> your game,&rdquo; said the long
Peter, with an entirely changed manner, &ldquo;pick and choose, my
lady, pick and choose! Here are silks and satins and laces, of which
I&rsquo;ve sold the dittos to <i>real</i> ladies and countesses; there
are&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, show me the dittos of what <i>real</i> ladies and
countesses have bought!&rdquo; exclaimed Aennerl, with a scream of
delight; and the pedlar, who was not much more scrupulous than others
of his craft, made haste to display his gaudiest wares, taking care not
to own that it was seldom enough his pack was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>lightened by the purchases of a &ldquo;<i>real</i>
lady.&rdquo; To have heard him you would have thought his dealings were
only with the highest of the land.</p>
<p>But it needed only to say, &ldquo;This is what my lady the Countess
of Langtaufers wears,&rdquo; &ldquo;This is what my lady the Baronin
Schroffenstein bought of me,&rdquo; for Aennerl to buy it at the
highest price the Long Peter&rsquo;s easy conscience could let him
extort; and, indeed, had he not felt a certain commercial necessity for
reserving something to keep up his connexion with his ordinary
customers on the rest of his line of route, orphan Aennerl would have
bought up all that was offered her under these pretences, and without
stopping to consider whether the materials or colours were well
assorted, or whether such titles as those with which the pedlar dazzled
her understanding existed at all!</p>
<p>The next day was a village festival in Reith. And the quiet people
of Reith thought the orphan Aennerl had gone fairly mad when they saw
at church the extravagant figure she cut in her newly-acquired finery;
for, in her hurry to display it, she had in one way and another piled
her whole stock of purchases on her person at once. A showy skirt
embroidered with large flowers of many colours, and trimmed with deep
lace, was looped up with bright blue ribbons and rosettes over a
petticoat of violet satin, beneath which another of a brilliant green
was to be seen. Beneath this again, you might <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>have
descried a pair of scarlet stockings; and on her shining shoes a pair
of many-coloured rosettes and shoe-buckles. The black tight-fitting
bodice of the local costume was replaced by a kind of scarlet
hussar&rsquo;s jacket trimmed with fur, fastened at the throat and
waist with brooches which must have been originally designed for a
stage-queen. From her ears dangled earrings of Brobdignagian
dimensions; and on her head was a hat and feathers as unlike the little
hat worn by all in Reith as one piece of head-gear could well be to
another.</p>
<p>Of course, it did not befit a lady so decked to take the lowly seat
which had served the orphan Aennerl; before the Divine office began she
had seated herself in the most conspicuous place in the church, so that
no one lost the benefit of the exhibition; and it may well be believed
that the congregation had no sooner poured out of the sacred building
than the appearance of the orphan Aennerl was the one theme of a
general and noisy conversation.</p>
<p>For some it was a source of envy; for some, of ridicule; for some
unsophisticated minds, of simple admiration. But the wiser heads kept
silence, or said, in tones of sympathy, &ldquo;The orphan Aennerl
isn&rsquo;t the girl the Goigner J&ouml;ssl took her for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>J&ouml;ssl had been to church in his own village of Goign, and had
therefore been spared the sight, as well as the comments it had
elicited. But as he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95"
name="pb95">95</a>]</span>came towards Reith to take his Aennerl for
the holiday walk, he noticed many strange bits of hinting in the
greetings he received, which puzzled him so, that, instead of going
straight on to Aennerl, he sat down on the churchyard wall, pondering
what it could all mean. &ldquo;I wish you joy of your orphan
Aennerl!&rdquo; one had said. &ldquo;Goigner J&ouml;ssl, Goigner
J&ouml;ssl, take my advice, and shun the threshold of orphan
Aennerl!&rdquo; were the words of another, and he was an old man and a
sage friend too. &ldquo;Beware, Goigner J&ouml;ssl, beware!&rdquo;
seemed written on every face he had met&mdash;what could it all mean?
He wandered forward uncertain, and then back again, then on again, till
he could bear it no longer, and he determined to go down to the
<i lang="de">Wirthshaus beim Stangl</i>, and ask his mates to their
face what they all meant.</p>
<p>Before he came in sight of the door, however, he changed his
resolution. Through the open window he heard noisy talk, and noisiest
of all was the voice of the Langer Peterl. Honest J&ouml;ssl had an
invincible antipathy to the wheedling, the gossip, the bluster, and the
evil tongue of the Langer Peterl, and he never trusted himself to join
his company, for he knew a meeting with him always led to words.</p>
<p>Determining to wait till he was gone, he walked about outside, and
as there is always a train of waggons waiting at the <i lang=
"de">Wirthshaus am Stangl</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href=
"#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>while the wayworn carters refresh
themselves, he could easily remain unperceived.</p>
<p>Thus, however, he became unintentionally the hearer of all he
desired to know&mdash;much <i>more</i> than he desired, I <i>should</i>
say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, she,&mdash;Aennerl would have bought my whole
pack if I&rsquo;d have let her!&rdquo; vociferated the Langer Peterl;
&ldquo;and I might have saved myself all further tramping, but that I
wouldn&rsquo;t disappoint my pretty Ursal, and Trausl, and Moidl, and
Marie,&rdquo; he added, in a tone of righteousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Buy</i> it, man! you don&rsquo;t mean buy it! She got it
out of you one way or another, but you don&rsquo;t mean she bought it,
in the sense of paying for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. I say, she paid for it in pure gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>that won&rsquo;t</i> do!&rdquo; said other voices;
&ldquo;where could she get gold from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>that&rsquo;s</i> not my affair,&rdquo; replied the
pedlar, &ldquo;where she got it from! It wouldn&rsquo;t do for a poor
pedlar to ask where his customers get their money from&mdash;ha! ha!
ha! I&rsquo;m not such a fool as that! I know the girl couldn&rsquo;t
have it rightfully, as well as you do, but it wouldn&rsquo;t do for me
to refuse all the money I suspect is not honestly come by&mdash;ha! ha!
I <i>should</i> then drive a sorry trade indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>J&ouml;ssl&rsquo;s first impulse had been to fly at the Langer
Peterl, and, as he would have expressed it, thrust the lie down his
throat; but then, he reflected; where <i>had</i> the girl got the money
from? what could he say? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href=
"#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>To dispute it without having means of
disproving it was only opening wider the sore; and while he stood
dejected and uncertain the conversation went on more animated than
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you!&rdquo; cried, between two whiffs of smoke,
an idle Bursch, on whom since the death of the Wilder J&uuml;rgl that
nickname had descended by common consent. &ldquo;What right have we to
be prying into our neighbour&rsquo;s business? If the girl&rsquo;s got
money, why should any one say she hasn&rsquo;t a right to it?
She&rsquo;s an uncommon fine girl, <i>I</i> say, and looks a long way
better than she did before in her beggarly rags; and a girl that can
afford to dress like that is not to be despised, <i>I</i>
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That the speaker had only received the cognomen of Wild after the
Wilder J&uuml;rgl was only in that he was younger; he had earned the
right to it in a tenfold degree. None of the steady lads of either
Goign or Reith or Elmau, or any other place in the neighbourhood, would
make a friend of him, and that is why he now sat apart from the others
smoking in a corner.</p>
<p>To be praised and defended by the Wilder Karl was a worse compliment
than to be suspected by the steadier ones. The words therefore threw
the assembly into some embarrassment for a moment, till the Kleiner
Friedl<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1953src" href="#xd21e1953" name=
"xd21e1953src">52</a>, a sworn friend of J&ouml;ssl, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>thinking
he ought to strike a blow in his defence somewhere, cried out, in a
menacing tone,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well played, Wilder Karl! but I see your game. You think
because the girl&rsquo;s got money she&rsquo;s a good chance for you.
You think her flaunting way will estrange steady Goigner J&ouml;ssl,
and then you think you may step in between them&mdash;and a sorry
figure she&rsquo;d cut two days after you&rsquo;d had the handling of
her! She wouldn&rsquo;t have much finery left then, I&rsquo;ll warrant!
The Langer Peterl there would have it all back at half-price, and that
half-price would all be in the pocket of our honest Wirth am Stangl.
But it&rsquo;s in vain; whatever she is, she&rsquo;ll be true to the
Goigner J&ouml;ssl, I&rsquo;ll warrant&mdash;and as for you, she
wouldn&rsquo;t <i>look</i> at you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wilder Karl rose to his feet, and glared at the Kleiner Friedl with
a glance of fury. &ldquo;I wager you every thing you and I have in the
world, that I&rsquo;ll make her dance every dance with me at the
Jause<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1965src" href="#xd21e1965" name=
"xd21e1965src">53</a> this very night!&rdquo; and he shook his fist
with a confident air, for he had a smooth tongue and a comely face, and
Aennerl would not have been the first girl these had won over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the Wirth, coming to
Friedl&rsquo;s rescue, who was but a young boy, and had felt rather
dismayed at the proposed wager, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m not sure, till all
this is cleared up, that I should admit her to the dance. But the
difficulty will not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99"
name="pb99">99</a>]</span>arise, for Aennerl herself told my daughter
Moidl that now she could wear a lady&rsquo;s clothes it would be
impossible for her to come any more to the village dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strengthened by the support of the Wirth<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1974src" href="#xd21e1974" name="xd21e1974src">54</a>, the
Kleiner Friedl felt quite strong again; and he could not forbear
exclaiming, &ldquo;There, I told you there was no chance for you,
Wilder Karl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Wilder Karl, furious at the disappointing news of the Wirth, and
maddened by the invective of the Kleiner Friedl, rushed at the boy
head-over-heels, bent on mischief.</p>
<p>But Wilder Karl, though a bully and a braggart, inspired no respect,
because no feather adorned his hat, and that showed he was no champion
of any manly pursuit. So the whole room was on the side of Kleiner
Friedl; and the bully having been turned out, and the subject of
conversation pretty well exhausted, the Goigner J&ouml;ssl turned
slowly home.</p>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t say that he was right here. He was an excellent
young man, endowed in an especial degree with Tirolese virtues. His
parents had never had a moment&rsquo;s uneasiness about him; no one in
the whole village was more regular or devout at church; in the field
none more hard-working or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href=
"#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>trustworthy; at the village games
and dances none acquitted himself better; and had a note of danger to
his country sounded in his time I am sure he would have been foremost
to take his place among its living ramparts, and that none would have
borne out the old tradition of steadfastness more manfully than he.</p>
<p>But of course he had his faults too. And one of his faults was the
fault of many good people,&mdash;the fault of expecting to find every
one as good as themselves, of being harsh and unforgiving, of sulking
and pining instead of having an open explanation.</p>
<p>Now, mind you, I think it would have been much better if J&ouml;ssl
had, after hearing the conversation I have just narrated, gone straight
on to Aennerl&rsquo;s, and had it all out with her, had heard from her
own lips the truth of the matter about which all Reith and Goign were
talking, and judged her out of her own mouth, giving her, if he could
not approve her conduct, advice by which she might mend it in the
future.</p>
<p>But this was not his way. He had thought his Aennerl a model, almost
a divinity. He had always treated her as such, talked to her as such,
loved her as such. It was clear now, however, that in some way or other
she had done wrong. Instead of getting to the bottom of it, and trying
to set it straight, he gave himself up to his disappointment
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>and went home and sulked, and refused to be
comforted.</p>
<p>Aennerl, meantime, knew nothing of all this. She had had a great
desire to be a lady and no longer a servant; and having plenty of
money, and plenty of fine clothes, she thought this made her a lady,
and had no idea but that every one acknowledged the fact. I don&rsquo;t
think she exactly wished that all the village should be envious of her,
but at all events she wished that she should enjoy all the prerogatives
of ladyhood, and this, she imagined, was one. Then she had no parents
to teach her better, and J&ouml;ssl, who might have been her teacher,
had forsaken her.</p>
<p>But it was all too new and too exciting for her to feel any
misgivings yet. She amused herself with turning over all her fine
things, and fancied herself very happy.</p>
<p>In another day or two the Hof of good neighbour Bartl was put up for
sale, and another visit to the Bergm&auml;nnlein enabled her to become
the purchaser. She thus became the most important proprietor in Reith;
but she was so little used to importance that she did not at all
perceive that the people treated her very differently from the former
proprietor of the Hof.</p>
<p>Before him every hat was doffed with alacritous esteem due to his
age and worth. But poor Aennerl hardly received so much as the old
greeting, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>which in the days of companionship in poverty
had always been the token of good fellowship with her, as with every
one.</p>
<p>It was long before any suspicion that she was mistrusted reached the
mind of Aennerl. In the meantime she enjoyed her new condition to the
full. Weekly visits to the R&ouml;hrerb&uuml;chel enabled her to
purchase every thing she desired; and when the villagers held back from
her, she ascribed their diffidence to the awe they felt for her
wealth.</p>
<p>In time, however, the novelty began to wear off. She grew tired at
last of giving orders to her farm-servants, and watching her sleek
cattle, and counting her stores of grain. That J&ouml;ssl had not been
to see her, she never ascribed to any thing but his respect for her
altered condition; and she felt that she could not demean herself by
being united to a lad who worked for day-wages.</p>
<p>Still grandeur began to tire, and her isolation made her proud, and
angry, and cross; and then people shunned her still more, and upon that
she grew more vexed and angry. But, worse than this, she got even so
used to her riches that she quite forgot all about the Nickel to whom
she owed them. Her farm was so well stocked that it produced more than
her wildest fancies required; she had no need to go back to the
R&ouml;hrerb&uuml;chel to ask for more gold, and she had grown too
selfish to visit it out of compassion to the dwarf. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Bergm&auml;nnlein upon this grew disappointed; but his
disappointment was of a different kind from J&ouml;ssl&rsquo;s. He was
not content to sit apart and sulk; he was determined to have his
revenge.</p>
<p>One bleak October night, when the wind was rolling fiercely down
from the mountains, there was a sudden and fearful cry of
&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; in the village of Reith. The alarm-bells repeated
the cry aloud and afar. The good people rose in haste, and ran into the
lane with that ready proffer of mutual help which distinguishes the
mountain-folk.</p>
<p>The whole sky was illumined, the fierce wind rolled the flames and
the smoke hither and thither. It was Aennerl&rsquo;s Hof which was the
scene of the devastation. The fire licked up the trees, and the farm,
and the rooftree before their eyes. So swift and unnatural was the
conflagration that the people were paralyzed in their endeavour to
help. One ran for ladders, another for buckets; but before any help
could be obtained the whole homestead was but one vast bonfire. Then,
madly rushing to the top of the high pointed roof, might be seen the
figure of Aennerl clothed only in her white night-dress, and shrieking
fearfully, &ldquo;Save me! save me!&rdquo; Every moment the roof
threatened to fall in, and the agonized beholders watched her and sent
up loud prayers, but were powerless to save.</p>
<p>Suddenly, on the road from Goign a figure was seen hasting along. It
was the Goigner J&ouml;ssl. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href=
"#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>Would he be in time? The crowd was
silent now, even their prayers were said in silence, for every one
gasped for breath, and the voice failed. A trunk of an old branchless
tree yet bent over the burning ruins. J&ouml;ssl had climbed that trunk
and was making a ladder of his body by which to rescue Aennerl all
frantic from the roof. Will he reach her? Will his arm be long enough?
Will he fall into the flame? Will he be overpowered by the smoke? See!
he holds on bravely. The smoke rolls above his head, the flames dart
out their fierce fangs beneath him! He holds on bravely still. He calls
to Aennerl. She is fascinated with terror, and hears him not.
&ldquo;Aennerl! Aennerl!&rdquo; once more, and his voice reached her,
and with it a sting of reproach for her scornful conduct drives her to
hide her face from his in shame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aennerl! Aennerl!&rdquo; yet once again; and he wakes her, as
from a dream, to a life like that of the past the frenzy had
obliterated. She forgets where she <i>is</i>; but the voice of
J&ouml;ssl sounded to her as it sounded in the years gone by, and she
obeys it mechanically. She comes within reach&mdash;and he seizes her!
But the flames are higher now, and the smoke denser and more blinding.
&ldquo;Jesus Maria! where are they? They have fallen into the flames at

shouts the crowd, a minute later. &ldquo;They are saved, <i lang=
"de">Gott sei dank</i>, they are saved!&rdquo; and a jubilant cry rings
through the valley which the hills take up and echo far and wide.</p>
<p>On the edge of the crowd, apart, stands a little misshapen old man
with grey, matted hair and beard, whom no one knows, but who has
watched every phase of the catastrophe with thrilling emotion.</p>
<p>It was he who first raised the cry that they had fallen into the
flames; and the people sickened as they heard it, for he spoke it in
joy, and not in anguish. In the gladness of the deliverance they have
forgotten the old man, but now he shouted once more, as he dashed his
hood over his head in a tone of disappointed fury, &ldquo;I did it! and
I will have my revenge yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; let there be peace,&rdquo; said J&ouml;ssl, who had
deposited Aennerl in safe hands, and now came forth to deal one more
stroke for her; &ldquo;let there be peace, old man, and let bygones be
bygones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said the Cobbold; &ldquo;I have said I will
have my revenge, and I will have it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; argued J&ouml;ssl, &ldquo;have you not <i>had</i>
your revenge? All you gave her you have had taken <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>away&mdash;she is as she was before: can you not
leave her so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; thundered the dwarf; &ldquo;I will have the life
of her before I&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; in his turn shouted J&ouml;ssl; and he placed
himself in front of the elf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; replied the dwarf, with a
cold sneer, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going after her. I&rsquo;ve only to
wait a bit, and she&rsquo;ll come after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>J&ouml;ssl was inclined to let him go, but remembering the
instability of woman, he thought it better to make an end of the
tempter there and then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you promise me, that if I let you return to your hole in
peace, you will do her no harm should she visit you there
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise you that I will serve her to the most frightful of
deaths&mdash;<i>that&rsquo;s</i> what I promise you!&rdquo; retorted
the enraged gnome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then your blood be on your own head!&rdquo; said J&ouml;ssl,
and, with his large hunting-knife drawn in his hand, he placed himself
in a menacing attitude before the now alarmed dwarf.</p>
<p>J&ouml;ssl was a determined, powerful youth, not to be trifled with.
The gnome trusted to the strength of his muscles, and fled with all his
speed; but J&ouml;ssl, who was a cunning runner too, maintained his
place close behind him. The dwarf, finding himself so hotly followed,
began to lose his head, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href=
"#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>and no longer felt so clearly as
at first the direction he had to take to reach the
R&ouml;hrerb&uuml;chel. J&ouml;ssl continued to drive him before him,
puzzling him on the zigzags of the path till he had completely lost the
instinct of his way of safety. Then, forcing him on as before to the
edge of the precipice, he closed upon him where there was no
escape.</p>
<p>Yes, one escape there was&mdash;it was in the floods of the
Brandenburger Ache, which roared and boiled away some hundred feet
below! Rather than fall ignominiously by the hand of a child of man,
the gnome dashed himself, with a fierce shout, down the abyss. And that
was the last that was ever seen of the Nickel of the
R&ouml;hrerb&uuml;chel.</p>
<p>Aennerl was now poorer than ever in this world&rsquo;s goods, but
she was rich in one deep and wholesome lesson&mdash;that it is not
glittering wealth which brings true happiness. The smiles of honest
friends, and the love of a true heart, and the testimony of an
approving conscience are not to be bartered away for all the gold in
all the mines of the earth.</p>
<p>Wilder Karl laughed with his two or three boon companions, and said,
with a burst of contempt, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt that fool of a
Goigner J&ouml;ssl will marry the orphan Aennerl now that she
hasn&rsquo;t a penny to bless herself with!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Wilder Karl judged right. Aennerl scarcely dared hope that
he could love her still, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href=
"#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>and she went forth humbly to her
work day by day, neither looking to the right hand nor the left,
accepting all the hardships and humiliations of her lot as a worthy
punishment of her folly and vanity.</p>
<p>But one evening as she came home from her toil, the Goigner
J&ouml;ssl came behind her, and he said softly in her ear, &ldquo;Do
you love me still, Aennerl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love you still, J&ouml;ssl!&rdquo; cried the girl; &ldquo;you
have thrice given me life&mdash;first when I was a poor, heartbroken
orphan, and you made me feel there was still some one to live for in
the world; and then a second time, in that dreadful fire, when hell
seemed to have risen up out of the earth to punish me before the time;
and now again this third time, when I began to think my folly had
sickened you for good and all! Don&rsquo;t ask me <i>that</i>,
J&ouml;ssl, for you must <i>know</i> I love you more than my life! If I
dared, there is one question I should ask you, Can <i>you</i> still
love <i>me</i>? but I have no right to ask that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must answer you in your own words, Aennerl,&rdquo; replied
J&ouml;ssl: &ldquo;you must <i>know</i> that I love you more than my
life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must, you must&mdash;you have shown it!&rdquo; exclaimed
Aennerl. They had reached the bank near the R&ouml;hrerb&uuml;chel
where we first saw them; the rosy light of the sunset, and the scent of
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>wild flowers, was around them just as on that
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Aennerl, after a pause, as if it were just
then that J&ouml;ssl had said the words<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2120src" href="#xd21e2120" name=
"xd21e2120src">57</a>&mdash;&ldquo;yes, J&ouml;ssl, this is happiness;
we want nothing more in this world than the warm sun, and the blue
sky&mdash;and to be together! Yes, J&ouml;ssl, we shall always be happy
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked on together; as they reached the memorial of the dead
miners the village bells rang the <i>Ave</i>. And as they knelt down,
how heartfelt was J&ouml;ssl&rsquo;s gratitude that the prayer he had
uttered at that spot once before had been so mercifully answered, and
his Aennerl restored to him for ever! <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">THE WILDER J&Auml;GER AND THE BARONESS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a rich and powerful baron who owned a broad
patrimony in South Tirol, Baron di Valle. He was not only one of the
richest and most powerful, he was also one of the happiest, for he had
the prettiest and most sensible woman of Tirol for his bride. The brief
days were all too short for the pleasure they found in each
other&rsquo;s society, and they were scarcely ever apart the whole day
through.</p>
<p>Once, however, the Baron went on a hunting party through a part of
the country which was too rough for the Baroness to follow him. The day
was splendid, the scent good, and the Baron full of enthusiasm for his
favourite sport; but what egged him on more than all these, was the
sight of a strange bold hunter who bestrode a gigantic mount, and who
dashed through brake and briar, and over hill and rock, as if no
obstacle could arrest him. Baron di Valle, who thought he was the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>boldest hunter of the whole country-side, was
quite mad to see himself outdone; nor could he suffer this to be.
Determined to outstrip his rival, he spurred his horse on, so that he
might but pass him somewhere; but the Wilder J&auml;ger, for it was he,
always kept on ahead, and though the brave Baron kept close to his
heels, he was never able to pass him by.</p>
<p>They had long outstripped all the rest. But all this time the Baron
had taken no note of whither he went; now he found himself in the midst
of a thick forest of tall fir-trees, with their lower branches cut off
because they were planted so thick and close together that there was no
room between them, and their tops were intergrown so that they formed
one compact mass, excluding the very air and the light of day. The Wild
Hunter stopped his mad career before this barrier, and then, turning,
pretended for the first time to be aware of the Baron&rsquo;s
presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want here?&rdquo; he exclaimed, fiercely, his
rolling eyes glaring like fire. &ldquo;How dare you invade my
domain!&rdquo; and with that he blew a mighty blast on his
hunting-horn, at sound of which a whole troop of wild huntsmen, habited
like himself, and with similar fiery eyes, appeared suddenly,
surrounding the Baron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand back!&rdquo; cried the Baron, in a commanding tone, as
the wild huntsmen dismounted and prepared to seize him. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No one commands here but I,&rdquo; said the Wilder
J&auml;ger. And then he added, addressing his men, &ldquo;Seize him,
and carry him off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; said the Count, but speaking more humbly than
before, for he saw he must yield something to the necessity of the
case; &ldquo;I suppose there is some ransom upon which you will let me
off? I have wronged you in nothing, and meant no offence. I admired
your brave riding, and I thought what one brave man might do, another
might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you take that tone,&rdquo; said the Wilder J&auml;ger,
&ldquo;I will do what I can for you. I will let you ransom yourself at
one price. You must know, that it is not you that I want at all; I only
lured you here as a means of getting hold of the Baroness, and had you
been uppish and violent, I should have kept you in chains for the rest
of your life, while I married her. But as you know how to keep a civil
tongue in your head, I will show you that I can appreciate courtesy. So
now I give you permission to return, to be yourself the bearer to your
wife of my conditions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her, then, that I have won her for my own, and she
belongs irrevocably to me; it is useless that she attempt to escape,
for you see that my people are countless, and violence is of no avail
against me. But I am a good sort of fellow, and as I love her, I
don&rsquo;t want to do any thing to alarm her, so long as she shows no
foolish resistance.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href=
"#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But the ransom? You spoke of a ransom just now,&rdquo;
interposed the Baron, hastily; &ldquo;what, about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in good time,&rdquo; replied the Wilder
J&auml;ger&mdash;&ldquo;give a fellow time to speak. The only mode of
ransom is this&mdash;let the Baroness guess my name. I give her three
guesses of three words each, and an interval of a month. But if she
doesn&rsquo;t succeed, remember, she is mine! this day month I appear
and claim her. If, in the meantime, she thinks she has made the guess,
and wants to satisfy herself as to its correctness&rdquo;&mdash;and he
laughed a ghastly laugh of scorn, as if to impress the Baron with the
hopelessness of the idea&mdash;&ldquo;she has only to come to the ilex
grove on the border of this forest which marks the frontier between
your territory and mine. If she stands there, beside the centre tree,
and blows this horn&mdash;see what a pretty little gold horn it is,
that I have had studded with diamonds and rubies&mdash;just fit for her
pretty little fingers!&rdquo; he added, with a grin of
scorn&mdash;&ldquo;at sound of her voice I shall be with her on the
instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Baron was not one to have tolerated such talk from any human
being soever, but he felt the necessity of vanquishing his temper this
time&mdash;a more difficult matter ordinarily than vanquishing a
foe&mdash;for a dearer life than his own was at stake; and if he could
not altogether save the Baroness from the power of the Wilder
J&auml;ger, he could take <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href=
"#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>counsel with her as to the means
of finding out the hidden name, and at least spend with her the last
days that he could call her his.</p>
<p>Accordingly he took the horn, and stuck it in his belt without a
word. And indeed no word would have availed him, for the whole troop of
the wild huntsmen had vanished as it came, and he was left alone.</p>
<p>There was no difficulty in finding his way back by the path by which
he had come, for it was plainly marked by the havoc of the surrounding
vegetation the wild chase had cost. And though he now put spurs to his
steed that he might reach home without losing an hour more than he
could help of the companionship of his beloved wife, he now for the
first time apprehended how swiftly he had come, for, riding the utmost
of mortal speed, it took him three days to get back to the ilex grove
which marked the boundary of his own territory. Hence it was still half
a day&rsquo;s journey to reach his castle. But while he was yet a great
way off his loving wife came out to meet him, full of joy at his
approach, for since the rest of the hunt had come home without him she
had done nothing but watch from the highest turret of the castle, that
she might catch the first sight of him returning; her thirsty eyes had
not been slow to discern his figure as he hastened home.</p>
<p>Great was her amazement, however, to find that, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>instead of returning her greeting with his
wonted delight, he turned his head away, as if he dared not look at
her, and wept. She rode beside him all the way home, but he still kept
silence, for he could not bear to render her sorrowful with the message
of which he was the bearer. But he could conceal nothing from her
loving solicitude, and soon he had told her all.</p>
<p>Being a woman of prudent counsel and strong trust in God, she was
much less cast down, however, than he had expected. Though bewildered
at first, and seeing no way out of the difficulty, she yet declared she
was sure some way of escape would be opened to her, it only remained to
consider where they should find it. And never a word of angry
recrimination did she utter to remind him that it was his mad vanity
had brought them to this plight.</p>
<p>The Baron felt the full force of this forbearance, for he did
nothing but reproach himself with his folly. But the fresh proof of her
amiability only occasioned another pang at the thought of the
approaching separation.</p>
<p>Still no good counsel came to mind, and the Baroness herself began
almost to lose heart. The Baron had abandoned the hunt and all his
sports, and sat gloomily in the ancient seat of his ancestors. The
Baroness sat among the flowers of her oriel window, her embroidery in
her hand; but her mind was far away over the tops of the dark green
trees, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>looking for some bright thought to bring
deliverance to her from above. Every morning and evening they knelt
together in the chapel of the castle, and prayed that a spirit of
prudence and counsel might be given them.</p>
<p>Ten days had passed, and no good thought had come. The Baron
reclined gloomily in the ancient seat of his ancestors, and the lady
sat among the flowers of the oriel window gazing over the tops of the
high dark fir-trees, full of hope that some wise counsel would be given
her. Suddenly she rose and clapped her hands, and her ringing laugh
brought the Baron bounding to her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have found it, Heinrich!&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;I am
sure I have found the name! Doesn&rsquo;t the Wilder J&auml;ger live
among the tall fir-trees?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; among the tall fir-trees is his dwelling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t he speak of three names?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; he said your guess must include three names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I have it, Heinrich! What more natural than that he
should be called from the names of the trees which form his palace? As
I was gazing over the tops of the high dark trees the words came into
my mind, &lsquo;Tree, Fir, Pine&rsquo;&mdash;those will be the three
words. Come, and let us go out to the ilex grove, and be free to belong
to each other as of old!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was so lively that the Baron caught some <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>spark of her hopefulness, but he was too far
sunk in despondency to enter into her joy all at once. Nevertheless, it
was not a moment when, if ever, he would have thwarted her, so he
ordered the horses to be saddled, for it was still early morning. And
they rode together to the ilex grove which was the boundary of the
Wilder J&auml;ger&rsquo;s domain; the Baroness striving every minute by
some sprightly speech to distract the Baron, and the Baron utterly
incapable of rousing himself from his gloomy fears.</p>
<p>The Baroness was the first to reach the grove; in fact, she had
ridden on a good way in advance, that she might have it out with the
Wilder J&auml;ger before her husband came, so that she might greet him
on his arrival with the news that she was free.</p>
<p>Merrily she sounded the jewelled horn, and before its sound had died
away the Wilder J&auml;ger was at her side. He no longer looked dusty,
wild, and fierce, as during the Baron&rsquo;s mad chase. He seemed a
man of noble presence, carefully dressed in a green hunting-suit, with
a powerful bow in his hand, and a beautiful boy to hold his arrows. In
his belt was a jewelled hunting-knife of exquisite workmanship, and to
a cord across his shoulder hung a golden horn of similar pattern to
that he had sent the Baroness, and, moreover, as a further act of
gallantry, he wore a scarf of red and white, the favourite colours of
the Baroness. A jewelled cap shaded the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>sun from his brow,
which a red and white plume gracefully crested.</p>
<p>The Baroness looked astonished to find she had nothing more
formidable to meet, and felt that had she not already been the wife of
the Baron di Valle, she would not have found it so great a calamity to
be obliged to marry the Wilder J&auml;ger.</p>
<p>The Wilder J&auml;ger was not slow to perceive that the impression
he had produced was good, and bowing towards her with courtly mien,
paid her a respectful salutation, and immediately added,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your eyes are so clever, fair Baroness, that I very much fear
you are going to pronounce my name, and rob me of the happiness I had
so nearly bought! Spare me, therefore, lovely lady&mdash;say <i>not</i>
the word! but come with me into the shady pine-forest, where you shall
have every thing heart can desire&mdash;the noblest palace, the widest
domain, and unlimited command; retainers without number, pleasures
without alloy, and every wish gratified without condition!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He approached her as he spoke. His eyes sparkled no longer with the
angry fury which had thrilled the Baron, but with a mild fire of
tenderness and devotion. Nothing more attractive and winning than his
whole appearance and manner could be conceived, and for a moment the
Baroness had almost forgotten the less accomplished&mdash;but, oh! more
sincere&mdash;passion of her Heinrich. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb119" href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span></p>
<p>It was only for a moment. The weakness passed, she instantly drew
herself up with dignity, and stepped back against the friendly
ilex.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not to hear such words I came,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;but to pronounce those which are to free me from ever having to
listen to such protestations again&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, say them not! say them not!&rdquo; said the Wilder
J&auml;ger, throwing himself at her feet. &ldquo;Any thing but that!
Name any wish by fulfilling which I can win your favour; name any
difficult task by accomplishing which I can prove myself worthy of your
love&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My love,&rdquo; said the Baroness, striving to speak coldly,
&ldquo;is another&rsquo;s already; you see, there is none to be won
from me. But interrupt me no more. I have guessed your name, to
discover which was to be the price of my freedom. It
is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wilder J&auml;ger clasped her feet in despair, entreating her
not to pronounce it, but she went on, with a clear, confident voice, to
utter the words,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tree! Fir! Pine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wilder J&auml;ger looked up as if he did not quite understand
what she meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, let go your hold, and let me pass, for I am free!&rdquo;
she said, resolutely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Free,&rsquo; say you?&rdquo; said the handsome
Cobbold, with astonishment. &ldquo;Free? did you mean you thought
<i>that</i> was my unknown name?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb120" href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the lady, in a voice of conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, it is nothing like it!&rdquo; he answered, with
glee, and yet not without a delicate regard for her disappointment.
&ldquo;No, that is not it; nor is it likely you should <i>ever</i>
arrive at it. So days of happiness are before us yet.&rdquo; He had no
need to kneel to her longer, but it was joy to him to be at her
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dare not to speak so before me!&rdquo; replied the Baroness,
trying to tear herself away. &ldquo;I know of no happiness, except with
Heinrich; and I am persuaded that, though I have failed this time, it
will yet be given to me to find the word which shall restore me to him
completely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Baron arrived as she finished speaking; and though he saw by the
sorrowful look which now had possession of her bright face, and the
triumphant mien of the Cobbold, that she had failed, and that she was
still under the Wilder J&auml;ger&rsquo;s spell, he was so incensed to
find him in such an attitude that he drew his sword, and would have
closed with him then and there, but the Wilder J&auml;ger blew one note
upon his horn, and in an instant he was surrounded, as before, by his
myrmidons, who unarmed him and held him bound upon the ground, while
the Cobbold himself approached to seize the hand of the Baroness. A
fiery fury took possession of him, and sparks darted from his eyes
which fell smouldering among the twigs of fir. Powerless to defend his
wife by force, the Baron <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href=
"#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>once more mastered his anger, and
reminded his adversary courteously of his promise to leave them at
peace for the interval of a month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am always ready to answer you in whatever tone you elect to
adopt,&rdquo; said the Wilder J&auml;ger, rising, and leaving the side
of the Baroness. &ldquo;You see, it is useless to attempt force against
me; but when you behave with due consideration, so will I.&rdquo; At a
sign from him the sprites loosed the Baron&rsquo;s bonds, gave him back
his sword, and held his stirrup with the most respectful care, while he
mounted his horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depart, then, unharmed,&rdquo; said the Wilder J&auml;ger,
&ldquo;since you set so much store on prolonging your suspense. I
should say, it was wiser to make the best of a bad bargain and submit
to your fate at once, with grace. However, I have given my word and
won&rsquo;t go back from it. I restrain my power over you till the full
end of the month; and, what is more, I not only give the lady three
guesses, but as many as she likes. For,&rdquo; he added, with a cynical
leer, &ldquo;she is as little likely to guess it in thirty as in three;
while every time that she chooses to essay the thing, it gives me the
happiness of seeing her.&rdquo; And he turned away with a peal of wild
laughter which made the lady shudder.</p>
<p>The sprites vanished as they had come; and the Baron and his wife
rode sadly home, without the courage to exchange a word. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span></p>
<p>If the Baroness had for a moment been won by the comely presence and
devoted admiration of the Wilder J&auml;ger, she had now seen enough
reason to fear his treacherous humour, and to dread her impending fate
as much as at the first.</p>
<p>They spent the rest of the evening in prayers and tears in the
chapel of the castle, and the next evening, and the next; and the days
flowed by as before, but more sadly, and with even less of hope. The
Baroness scarcely now dared raise her eyes so high as the tops of the
tall dark trees; they fell abroad over the beautiful landscape
stretched out beneath them, and the good gifts of God cropping up out
of the ground; and she thought how beautiful was that nature to which
she must so soon say adieu!</p>
<p>Thus ten days passed without a gleam of expectation. Suddenly she
rose and clapped her hands; and her silvery laugh brought her husband
bounding to her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it this time, Heinrich!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>And the Baron listened anxiously, but trusted himself never to
speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Said you not that the Wilder J&auml;ger&rsquo;s domain was
entirely among the tall dark trees?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it seemed to me it was,&rdquo; responded her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>I</i> certainly discerned through the forest patches
of ripe golden grain. Saw you them not too?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The first time I rode too fast to notice them, but I do think
on this last journey I saw such here and there by the
wayside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; continued the lady, &ldquo;it is hence he
takes his name; these small patches of golden grain are more worth than
all the vast forests. Order the horses, for I have guessed his name! It
came to my mind just now, as I looked over the harvest-fields stretched
out yonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wheat, Oats, Maize&mdash;that will be his name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Baron knew her counsel had often proved right when he least
expected, and even disputed it, and though he was now too desponding to
expect success, he was likewise least inclined to dispute her word. So
he ordered the horses round, for it was yet early morning, and they
rode to the ilex grove.</p>
<p>The Baroness, whose hope seemed to rise as she got nearer the goal
of the journey, was full of spirit and cheerfulness, and, finding it
impossible to work up the Baron to the same expectation as herself,
rode on to accomplish her work ere he arrived.</p>
<p>One note of the jewelled horn brought the Wilder J&auml;ger to her
presence.</p>
<p>As she had failed before, he had less fear of her success this time,
and he was proportionately less subservient and submissive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you think you are come to give me my <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>dismissal, beautiful Baroness? But you have no
reason to repulse me so&mdash;be assured I mean it well with you; and
though there is no limit to my power over you, I shall never treat you
otherwise than with honour,&rdquo; he said, with a little scornful
laugh which suited his fine features exactly, and made him look
handsomer than before. And as he spoke so, his haughty tone, not
unmixed with warmth and admiration, thrilled her with the notion that,
after all, if it were not for her troth plighted to the Baron, it would
not be so very dreadful to owe obedience to one who knew how to command
so gracefully.</p>
<p>But it was only for a moment. The weakness passed, she drew herself
up with dignity, and, retreating against the support of the friendly
ilex, said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence! and remember your promise to leave me at peace till
the fatal month is out. I cannot listen to you. And now for your
name&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cobbold bowed, with a half-mocking, half-respectful inclination,
as if forcing himself to listen out of courtesy, but secure that she
would not guess right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wheat! Oats! Maize!&rdquo; said the Baroness, with a positive
air.</p>
<p>The Cobbold stared comically, as if doubting whether she was in
earnest; and at last, as if to relieve her out of politeness, he
replied,&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125"
name="pb125">125</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear no, that&rsquo;s not at all like it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Baroness hung her head in despair; then, drawing herself up
again, she said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know you are not deceiving me? You say this is not
your name, and I have to believe you&mdash;but suppose I maintain that
it <i>is</i> it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not fair, beautiful Baroness,&rdquo; replied the
Wilder J&auml;ger, with a charming dignity. &ldquo;I have never
deceived you, nor ever would I deceive so noble a lady! what I have
promised, I have kept; but in this case I have no means of deceiving
you&mdash;great as is my power, that is one thing beyond it. Could a
mortal, indeed, discover and pronounce my name in my presence, I could
not stand before him an instant. But this it is not given to mortals to
know, and that is why I proposed this difficulty to you. Should I have
paid you so bad a compliment,&rdquo; he added, with his cynical laugh,
&ldquo;as to render it possible that I should lose so great a
prize?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Baron rode up while he was saying this, and shrank dumb with
despair at the cruel words and the positive tone in which they were
uttered.</p>
<p>Without condescending to exchange a word with the Cobbold this time,
he lifted his wife on to her palfrey and rode away with her in
silence.</p>
<p>It was now all over. His despondency even gained the Baroness, and
she ceased to rack her brain with the hope of finding the inconceivable
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>name. Her eye not only dared not raise itself to
the tall dark trees&mdash;it had not even power to range over the
landscape. With her head sunk upon her breast, she sat silently among
her flowers in her oriel window, nor cared even to look at them. Only
in the morning and the evening they knelt together in the chapel of the
castle, and prayed that the calamity might pass away yet.</p>
<p>The days went by, and now the last but one had come; and the
Baroness trembled, for her imagination pictured the Cobbold coming to
carry her away. But her courage did not forsake her even now, and she
proposed to go out into the forest to meet her fate, as more noble than
waiting for it to overtake her.</p>
<p>The Baron, too dispirited to discuss any matter, and indifferent to
every thing, now that all he cared for was to be taken from him, gave a
listless consent. The next morning, having prayed and wept together in
the castle chapel, they set out on their mournful pilgrimage, the young
wife led as a lamb to the sacrifice.</p>
<p>The flowers bloomed beneath their feet, and the sun shone warm
overhead, the birds sang blithe and gay&mdash;all nature was bright and
fresh; but with heavy hearts they passed through the midst, nor found a
thought but for their own great sorrow. As they came to the borders of
the forest, however, the Baroness discerned the cry as of one in
distress. Forgetting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127"
name="pb127">127</a>]</span>for the moment her own agony, her
compassionate heart was at once moved, and she begged her husband to
turn aside with her, and find out the poor wretch who pleaded so
piteously. In a little time they had followed up the sound, and they
found one of the Wilder J&auml;ger&rsquo;s men tied in front of a
lately lighted fire. In a few minutes more the heaped-up wood would
have been all in flames, and then the luckless wight must have been
slowly roasted! At a word from the Baroness, the Baron cut his bonds;
and then they inquired what was the occasion of his punishment.
&ldquo;Oh, it don&rsquo;t want much to get a punishment out of the
Wilder J&auml;ger!&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he so very severe, then?&rdquo; asked the Baroness, her
cheek blanching with fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At times, yes; it depends how the fancy takes him&mdash;if he
is out of humour he spares no one. If he were not so violent and
arbitrary, I would do you a good turn for that you have done me; but I
dare not, his anger is too fearful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more he descanted on the Wilder J&auml;ger&rsquo;s barbarity,
the more the Baroness prayed that he would tell her the word that would
save her; but he dared not, and all her instance was in vain.
&ldquo;And yet there might be a means,&rdquo; he said, for he was
desirous of doing a service to his deliverers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, speak! tell us what we can do&mdash;no matter what it is,
we will do it!&rdquo; answered both at once. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you happen to <i>overhear</i> it, I shan&rsquo;t
have <i>told</i> you, and yet it will serve your turn just as
well;&rdquo; and with that he walked on close in front of them, singing
carelessly as he went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are we to &lsquo;overhear&rsquo; it, Heinrich?&rdquo;
said the Baroness, after a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to have forgotten us,&rdquo; replied the Baron, in
despair. &ldquo;I have been expecting him every minute to turn round
and give us a hint of how he meant to help us; but it is just like
every one you do a favour to&mdash;when they have got what they want,
they forget all about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked on in silence; and the fellow kept on close in front of
them, singing as before, and always the same verse.</p>
<p>At last the Baroness got wearied with hearing the same thing over
and over again, and she began repeating the words over to herself,
mechanically. She could not make them out at all at first, for he had a
rough, abrupt articulation, but by dint of perseverance in an
occupation which served as a distraction to her agony, she at last made
it out, word by word:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The Wild Huntsman&rsquo;s betrothed (though he
is not tamed)</p>
<p class="line xd21e2366">To a lady fair</p>
<p class="line xd21e2366">Driven to despair.</p>
<p class="line xd21e2370">If she only knew he&rsquo;s Burzinigala
named!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;&lsquo;Burzinigala named!&rsquo; exclaimed the
Baroness, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>with the ringing laugh of former days, and
clapping her hands merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it all right this time, you may depend,
Heinrich!&rdquo; and she laughed again.</p>
<p>The Baron was too delighted for words&mdash;he embraced his wife in
his joy; and they walked on with a very different mien from what they
wore before. The first joy over, they turned to thank their helper; but
he had already disappeared, climbing over the tops of the trees to get
out of sight of the Wilder J&auml;ger&rsquo;s eye for as long as might
be.</p>
<p>There was no more lingering now, they hasted on, anxious only to
proclaim their triumph.</p>
<p>The ilex grove was soon reached, and the jewelled horn quickly
produced the Wilder J&auml;ger.</p>
<p>To-day he was habited with greater care even than on the former
occasions, and there was also still more assurance in his manner, and
still more forwardness to flatter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, lady fair,&rdquo; he said, with a mocking air,
&ldquo;do you deem you have guessed my name this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, it is so difficult,&rdquo; replied the lady,
&ldquo;that how can you think I can hope to succeed? Besides, why
should I wish to do what would deprive me of so charming a
companion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wilder J&auml;ger in his turn was perturbed. Nothing could have
made him happier than to hear such words from her lips, could he have
deemed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>them sincere; but there was an irony in her tone
and a playfulness in her countenance which showed that her heart was
not in her words. Yet he felt convinced she could not discover his
name; and so he knew not what to think, and scarcely what to say. And
the Baroness, delighting in his confusion, continued teasing him, like
a cat with a mouse.</p>
<p>After a good deal of this bantering, in which the Wilder J&auml;ger
got quite bewildered, the Baroness rose majestically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have we not had enough talking?&rdquo; she said, with
emphasis; &ldquo;when are you going to take me home&mdash;Sir
<span class="sc">Burzinigala</span>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be impossible to describe the effect of this word. He rose
from the earth with one bound. The beauty, the calmness, the commanding
air, which had at one time charmed the Baroness, had all fled. Wild,
savage, and furious as he had first appeared and tenfold more, he now
showed; and the sparks flew from his eyes on all around. Through the
thick tops of the trees he passed, they hardly knew how; and soon the
only trace of him left was that of the sparks that smouldered on the
dry heath.</p>
<p>It only remained for the Baron and Baroness to return home, locked
in each other&rsquo;s arms. And they continued loving each other more
than ever before to the end of their days. <span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">THE GRAVE PRINCE AND THE BENEFICENT CAT.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There once was a king in Tirol who had three sons. The
eldest was grave and thoughtful beyond his years; but he seldom spoke
to any one, took no pleasure in pastimes, and lived apart from those of
his age. The other two were clever and merry, always forward at any
game, or at any piece of fun, and passed all their time in merry-making
and enjoyment.</p>
<p>Now though the eldest son was, by his character, more adapted to
make a wise and prudent sovereign, yet the two younger brothers, by
their lively, engaging manner, had made themselves much more popular in
the country; they were also the favourites of their father, but the
eldest was the darling of his mother.</p>
<p>The king was old and stricken in years, and would gladly have given
up the cares of government, and passed his declining years in peace,
but he could not make up his mind to which of the brothers he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>should delegate his authority. The queen was
persuaded of the excellent capacity of her eldest son; but the two
younger were always saying he was half mad, and not fit to govern, and
as they had the people on their side, he greatly feared lest the
kingdom should be involved in civil war, so he always put off making
any arrangement.</p>
<p>One day, however, an ancient counsellor observed to him, that if he
really feared that there would be a dispute about the succession, it
was much better to have it decided now while he was alive to act as
umpire, than that it should befall when they would be left to wrangle
with no one to make peace between them.</p>
<p>The king found the counsel good, and decided to retire from the
government, and to proclaim his eldest son king in his stead. When the
two younger sons, however, heard what he intended to do, they came to
him and urged their old charge, that their elder brother was not fit to
govern, and entreated the king to halve the kingdom between them. But
the king, anxious as he was to gratify them, yet feared to displease
the queen by committing so great an injustice against her eldest son;
and thus they were no further advanced than before.</p>
<p>Then the old counsellor who had offered his advice before spoke
again, and suggested that some task should be set for the three, and
that whoever succeeded in that should be king beyond dispute.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span></p>
<p>The three sons all swore to abide by this decision; and the king
found the counsel good. But now the difficulty arose, what should he
set them to do? for they had insisted so much on the weak intellect of
the eldest, that the queen feared lest, after all, he should fail in
the trial, and her care for him be defeated. She knew he had never
practised himself in feats of strength, or in the pursuit of arms, so
it was useless proposing such as these for the test, but she persuaded
him to set them something much simpler.</p>
<p>So, having called an assembly of all the people, he proclaimed aloud
that the three brothers should travel for a year and a day, and
whichever of them should bring him back the finest drinking-horn,
<i>he</i> should be the king&mdash;the three sons swearing to abide by
his award.</p>
<p>The two younger brothers set out with a great retinue; and, as they
did not apprehend much difficulty in surpassing their brother in
whatever they might undertake, they spent the greater part of the year
allowed them in amusing themselves, secure in bringing back the best,
whatever they might bring.</p>
<p>The eldest set out alone through the forest. In his lonely
wanderings he had often observed a strangely beautiful castle on a
far-off mountain, concerning which he could find no record in any of
his books, nor could he learn that any one living knew any thing about
it. He now resolved to make <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href=
"#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>his way thither, persuaded that if
he was to find something surpassing the work of human hands, it was
like to be in this enchanted castle.</p>
<p>Though it was so high-placed, the way was much easier than he
thought, and he was not more than five months getting there; so that he
had ample time for exploring its precincts, and yet get back within the
appointed date. He had, indeed, to traverse dark forests and steep
rocky paths, but when he got near the castle all these difficulties
ceased. Here there were only easy slopes of greensward, diapered by
sparkling flowers; broad-leaved trees throwing delicious shade; and
rills that meandered with a pleasant music. Delicious bowers and
arcades of foliage of sweet-scented plants invited to repose; and every
where luscious fruits hung temptingly within reach. Birds sang on every
branch with a soft, dreamy melody which soothed, and disturbed not the
lightest slumber.</p>
<p>The prince thought it would have been delightful to pass the
remainder of his days there, but he remembered that it was an important
mission with which he was entrusted, and he passed on.</p>
<p>A broad flight of marble steps led from these amenities up to the
palace, and every now and then a thousand little jets were turned on,
to pour their tiny floods over them, and cool them for the tread of
those who entered.</p>
<p>And yet no one was near, no one to enjoy all <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>this
magnificence! The prince entered the hall, but no one came to meet him;
he passed through the long corridors&mdash;all were deserted; he
entered one apartment after another&mdash;still no one. At last he came
to one charming boudoir all hung with pink satin, and lace, and
beautiful flowers. On a pink satin sofa covered with lace sat a large
Cat with soft grey fur, and soft grey eyes&mdash;the first living thing
he had met!</p>
<p>As he entered, the Cat rose to meet him, walking on her hind-paws,
and, holding out her right front-paw in the most gracious manner, asked
him, in a sweet, clear voice, if there was any thing she could do for
him. Then, as if the effort was too great, she let herself down on all
fours, and rubbed her soft grey head against his boots.</p>
<p>Finding her so friendly, he was going to take her up in his arms:
this she would not allow, however, but sprang with an agile bound on to
a ledge above his head. &ldquo;And now tell me,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;what is it you want me to do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Lady Purrer, you are so kind, you confuse me! But, to
tell you the truth, I fear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fear that a poor puss can&rsquo;t be of any use,&rdquo;
interposed the Cat, smartly, &ldquo;and that your requirements are much
above her feeble comprehension. But never mind, tell me all the same;
there is little fear but that I can help you, and if I can&rsquo;t, the
telling me will do you no harm.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite the contrary,&rdquo; replied the prince, &ldquo;it will
be a great pleasure to have only your sympathy, for I am in great
distress.&rdquo; Her voice was so sweet and kind, that he quite forgot
it was only a Cat he was talking to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor prince!&rdquo; said the Cat, soothingly; &ldquo;tell me
all about it, then. But stop, I&rsquo;ll tell you first what <i>I</i>
think. I&rsquo;m sure you are not appreciated at home. I saw it in your
look when you first came in. You don&rsquo;t look bright and
enterprising, as you ought to look. You look as if you lived too much
alone. Oh, you would be twice as handsome if you only looked a little
more lively and energetic&mdash;&rdquo; and then she stopped short, and
sneezed a great many times, as if she feared she had said what was not
quite proper, and some other sound would efface that of her words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a great deal of truth in what you say,&rdquo;
replied the prince; &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t care much about me at
home&mdash;at least my mother does, but my father and brothers
don&rsquo;t. And I do live too much alone&mdash;but it&rsquo;s not my
fault: it&rsquo;s a bad way of mine, and I don&rsquo;t know how to get
out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want some one to pet you, and spoil you, and make you
very happy; and then you would be pleased to go into the society of
others, because then you could say to yourself, I&rsquo;ll show them
that there&rsquo;s some one understands me and makes a fuss about
me&mdash;&rdquo; and she stopped short, as before. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But who should care to spoil and pet <i>me</i>?&rdquo; cried
the prince, despondingly, and too much interested in her words to see
any reason why she should be confused at what she had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, a nice little wife, to be sure!&rdquo; replied the
Cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wife!&rdquo; exclaimed the prince; &ldquo;oh yes, my
father&rsquo;s grey-bearded counsellors will find me some damsel whom
it is necessary I should marry for the peace of the kingdom; and to her
I shall be tied, and, be she an idiot or a shrew, I shall have no voice
in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you mean to say,&rdquo; retorted the Cat, in a more
excited voice, &ldquo;that if you found a nice little princess&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t say any one they could with justice object to, but a real
princess&mdash;who cared very much for you, and made you very happy,
very happy indeed, so that you determined to marry her, that you
wouldn&rsquo;t be man enough to say to your father and all his
counsellors, &lsquo;Here is the princess I mean to make my wife; I feel
Heaven intended her for me. I am sure she will be the joy of my people,
as she is mine, and no other shall share my throne&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Wouldn&rsquo;t</i> I,&rdquo; exclaimed the prince, with
energy, starting to his feet, and placing his hand instinctively on his
sword, his eye flashing and the colour mounting in his cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! if you always looked like that! Now, you are handsome
indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed the Cat, enthusiastically, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>and
purred away. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she added, immediately after,
&ldquo;all this time you haven&rsquo;t told me what it was you came
for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the prince, despondingly, at finding himself
thus recalled to the prosaic realities of his melancholy life from that
brief dream of happiness. &ldquo;No; because you have been talking to
me of more interesting things&rdquo; (the Cat purred audibly); and then
he told her what it was had really brought him there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, your mother understands your character better than
all the rest,&rdquo; said the Cat. &ldquo;She knew you could be trusted
to prove your superiority over your brothers, though the others hope
you may fail. However, fail you won&rsquo;t this time, for I can give
you a drinking-horn which neither your brothers nor any one else on
earth can match!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that she sprang lightly on to the soft carpet, and ran out of
the room, beckoning to him to follow her. She led him through a long
suite of rooms till they came to a large dining-hall all panelled with
oak and filled with dark carved-oak furniture. In the centre of one end
of this hall, high up in the panelling, was an inlaid safe or
tabernacle curiously wrought. Puss gave one of her agile springs on to
the top of this cabinet, and, having opened its folding-doors gently
with her paw, disclosed to view a drinking-horn such as the prince had
never seen. It was a white semi-transparent horn, but close-grained,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>like ivory, and all finely carved with designs
of curious invention; the dresses of the figures were all made of
precious stones cunningly let in, and they sparkled with a vivid
lustre, like so many lamps. Then it had a rim, stand, and handle of
massive gold exquisitely chased, and adorned with rows of pearls and
diamonds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind Lady Purrer,&rdquo; exclaimed the prince, &ldquo;you are
right, there is no doubt of my success! But how can I ever sufficiently
thank you for what you have done for me? for I owe all to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a little to your own discernment too,&rdquo; said the
Cat, archly. &ldquo;And now, always look as much alive and as bright as
you do now, and you will see people will think better of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when shall I see you again, most sweet counsellor? May I
come back and see you again?&rdquo; pleaded the prince, and he tried to
stroke her sleek fur as she rubbed her soft grey head, purring, against
his boots. The stroking, however, she would by no means allow, but
springing again on to the top of the cabinet, she said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; it will not be long before you will have to come
back to me, I know. But go, now; you have spent more time here than you
think, and you have only just enough left to get back within the
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince turned to obey her; and the Cat jumped down, and ran by
his side, purring. When <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href=
"#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>he got out into the grounds again,
she followed him, climbing from tree to tree; and when he came to the
boundary-wall she ran all along on the coping. But here at last they
had to part, to her great regret, and for many a lonely mile he still
heard her low and plaintive mew.</p>
<p>It was true, he must have spent more time in her pleasant company
than he had thought, for when he reached home he found the day of trial
had arrived; the streets were deserted, and all the people gathered in
the palace to see the drinking-horns his brothers had brought, and
talking loudly of their magnificence. He passed through their midst
without being recognized, for the people knew him so little; and thus
he heard them speak of his younger brothers:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What bright faces they have! and what a merry laugh! it does
the heart good to hear them,&rdquo; said one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how the kingdom will be divided, and which half will
be to which of them,&rdquo; said another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my part, I don&rsquo;t care to the lot of which I fall,
for both are excellent good fellows,&rdquo; replied a third.</p>
<p>And thus they had clearly settled in their own mind that his
brothers had carried the day, and they didn&rsquo;t even trouble
themselves to think what he would bring, or whether he would come back
at all. It was the same thing all the way along. The words were varied,
but the same idea prevailed every <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141"
href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>where, that the younger
brothers had made good their claim; there was no question at all of the
eldest. The prince&rsquo;s face was growing moody again; but just then
one good woman, wiping the soap-suds from her hands as she turned from
her washing at the river to join the throng, exclaimed, as she heard
some neighbours talking thus, &ldquo;Hoity toity! it&rsquo;s all very
well with you and your laughing princes&mdash;a grave one for me, say
I! Laughing may lead a man to throw away his money, but it won&rsquo;t
teach him to feed the poor, or govern a kingdom. Wait till the <i>Grave
Prince</i> comes back! I&rsquo;ll warrant he&rsquo;ll bring the bravest
drinking-horn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A chorus of mocking laughter greeted her defence of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> bring the bravest drinking-horn!&rdquo; said
one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe he knows what a drinking-horn is
for&mdash;or drink either!&rdquo; said another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; his brothers understand <i>that</i> best, at all events.
I like a man who can drink his glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I like one who <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i> drink it, whether he
<i>can</i> or not; but keeps his head clear for his business,&rdquo;
said the good wife who had defended him before.</p>
<p>And as there were a good many who were too fond of the bottle in the
crowd, the laugh raised at him was turned against them.</p>
<p>He had <i>one</i> defender, then, in all that mass of people, but
all the rest judged him incapable, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb142" href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>without trial! He was
too disheartened, to make his way into the great hall where the success
of his brothers was being proclaimed, but instead trod sadly and
secretly up to his mother&rsquo;s chamber.</p>
<p>The queen was too distressed at the absence of her favourite son to
take part in the jocular scene below, and was seated, full of anxiety,
at her window, watching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you <i>here</i>, my son?&rdquo; she exclaimed, when
he entered; &ldquo;you have but one short half-hour more, and the time
will be expired. The sun is already gone down, and the time once past,
whatever you have brought, it will avail you not! Haste, my son, to the
council-hall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is useless, mother; all are against me!&rdquo; cried the
prince; and he laid the beautiful flagon on the table, and sank upon a
chair.</p>
<p>In the mean time it had grown dark, but the queen, impelled by her
curiosity to know what success her son had had, pulled off the wrapper
that enclosed the drinking-horn, and instantly the apartment was
brilliantly lighted by the light of the precious stones with which it
was studded!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son, this is a priceless work! This is worth a kingdom!
Nothing your brothers can have brought can compare with
this&mdash;haste, then, my son!&rdquo; and she led him along.</p>
<p>It was dark in the council-hall too; but when the queen had dragged
her son up to the throne <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href=
"#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>where the king sat, she uncovered
the flagon, and the sparkling stones sent their radiance into every
part.</p>
<p>Then there was one shout of praise. The drinking-horns of the
younger brothers, which had anon been so highly extolled, were no more
thought of, and every one owned that the Grave Prince had won the
trial.</p>
<p>The king declared it was too late for any more business that night,
the proclamation of the new sovereign would be made the next morning;
and in the meantime they all retired to rest, the Grave Prince with
some new sensations of satisfaction and hope, and the queen assured of
the triumph of her son.</p>
<p>But in the silent night, when all were wrapt in slumber, and the
king could not sleep for the anxiety and perplexity which beset him as
to his successor, the two young brothers came to him and complained
that they had been circumvented. The Grave Prince had always shown
himself so gloomy and unenergetic, it was impossible they could
conceive he was going to distinguish himself, so they had taken no
trouble to beat him; but if their father would but allow another trial,
they would undertake he should not have the advantage of them
again.</p>
<p>So the next day, instead of proclaiming the new sovereign, the king
announced that he had determined there should be a fresh trial of
skill; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>whichever of the princes should bring him the
best hunting-whip, that day year, should have the crown.</p>
<p>The princes set off next day on their travels once more, the eldest
son of course directing his towards the castle of the Beneficent
Cat.</p>
<p>This time he had not to traverse a file of deserted halls before
meeting her; she sat looking out for him on the coping of the wall
where he had left her mewing so piteously when he last parted from
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you it would not be long before you would have to come
back to me,&rdquo; she said, as he approached. &ldquo;What can I do for
you this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brothers are discontented at being beaten with <i>your</i>
beautiful beaker,&rdquo; replied the prince, gallantly, &ldquo;and they
have demanded another trial: this time my father sends us in quest of a
hunting-whip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hunting-whip?&rdquo; echoed the Cat; &ldquo;that is lucky,
for I can suit you with one neither they nor any one else on this earth
can surpass!&rdquo; and she frisked merrily along the path before him
till they came to the stables; then she took him into a room where all
manner of saddles, and horse-gear, and hunting-horns were stored. But
on a high ledge, at the very top of the room, was a dusty hunting-whip
of the most unpretending appearance. With one of her bold springs she
reached the ledge, and jumped down again with this whip in her
mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not much to look at, I own,&rdquo; she said, as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>she observed the perplexed look with which the
prince surveyed the present; &ldquo;but its excellent qualities are its
recommendation. You have but to crack this whip, and your horse will
take any thing you put him at, be it a river half a mile wide, or a
tree fifty feet high. There are plenty of horses in the stable, saddle
any of them you like, and make experience of it for
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince did as she bid him; and at sound of the enchanted whip
his mount leapt with equal ease over hills and valleys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a whip indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed the prince, his face
flushed with the unwonted exercise, and his heart beating high at the
idea of being the bearer of such a prize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s how I like to see you!&rdquo; said the
friendly puss; &ldquo;I like to see you like that. Now you are handsome
indeed!&rdquo; and she scampered away, as if coyly ashamed of what she
had said.</p>
<p>It was not long before she returned; and then she invited the prince
into the next room, where an elegant dinner was laid out, of which the
Cat did the honours very demurely. A high divan was arranged at the top
of the table, on which she reclined, and ate and lapped alternately out
of the plates ready before her, while invisible attendants served the
viands and filled the glasses.</p>
<p>When they had finished their meal, they went out to repose in the
flowery bowers; and when the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href=
"#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>heat of the day was past, the
Beneficent Cat reminded her guest that he must be thinking of going
home, if he would not that his brothers should supplant him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must I go so soon, sweet Lady Purrer?&rdquo; replied the
prince. &ldquo;I know not how to part from you; it seems I should be
happy if I were always with you. I have never felt so happy any where
before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very gallant, prince,&rdquo; responded the Cat,
&ldquo;and you have no idea how well it becomes you to look as you do
now; but the affairs of your kingdom must be your first thought. You
must first secure your succession&mdash;and then we must look out for
the nice little wife we talked of last time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; sighed the Grave Prince, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk
of that&mdash;that is not for me! No one beautiful enough for me to
care about will ever care for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you look desponding and gloomy, like that,&rdquo;
replied the Cat. &ldquo;Do you know, you look quite like another being
when you look so gloomy; and yet you can be <i>so</i> handsome when you
look bright and hopeful! But now,&rdquo; she proceeded, laying her soft
paw on his arm to arrest the futile justification which rose to his
lips, &ldquo;before you go, I have something very important to tell
you. You will now go back, and with the hunting-whip I have given you,
you are safe to win the trial which is to establish your right to the
kingdom. But there will be yet another trial exacted of you, and you
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>will have to come back again to me. What you are
to do then, I must tell you now, for it requires great prudence and
courage, and one principal thing is, that you don&rsquo;t say a word to
me all the time. Can you promise that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>that</i> is hard indeed,&rdquo; said the prince;
&ldquo;but still, if you command it, I think I can promise to obey, for
the sake of pleasing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the next thing is harder. Do you think you can do
<i>whatever</i> I command?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I am sure I can promise that!&rdquo; replied the
prince, warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind, <i>whatever</i> I command, then&mdash;however hard, or
however dreadful it may be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>any thing</i>&mdash;however hard, or however
dreadful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will you swear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you doubt my courage,&rdquo; said the prince, half
offended. &ldquo;You take me for a fool, like the rest. But no wonder;
I know I look like a fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t look gloomy again! you were so handsome just
now when you said so firmly you would do &lsquo;<i>any
thing</i>.&rsquo; Will you gratify me by swearing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You doubt my courage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t doubt your courage. But I know how terrible
a thing I have to command you; and I know how many others have failed
before you. Now will you not swear, but to please me?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I swear,&rdquo; said the prince, energetically,
&ldquo;to do whatever it may be that you tell me to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, remember, you have undertaken it solemnly. This is what
you must do. When you come in, you will find me sitting on the kitchen
stove; you must then seize me by my two hind-paws, and dash me upon the
hearthstone till there is nothing left of me in your hands, but the
fur!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear! I can never do <i>that</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed the
prince, in great embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have sworn to do whatever I told you!&rdquo; replied
the Cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but I thought you were going to order me to do
something rational, something noble and manly, requiring courage and
strength&mdash;not a horrible act like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is <i>the</i> thing that has to be done, it does not
matter what it is. Besides, it <i>does</i> require courage, great
courage; and that is why I would not tell you first what it was,
because others have failed when they knew what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you expect me to have less feeling and affection for you
than they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but I expect more sense and judgment of you. I expect you
to understand and believe that if I say it has to be done, it is really
for the best, and that you will trust to me that it is right. And I
expect that you will respect your promise, which was made without limit
or exception. But <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149"
name="pb149">149</a>]</span>now, go; you have no time to lose, if you
want to reach home with the hunting-whip in time for the
trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose to leave; and she followed him down the path, purring by his
side. And after she had taken leave of him at the boundary-wall, he
heard her mewing sad adieus as he went on for many a weary mile.</p>
<p>When the prince reached the council-hall, he found, as before, that
his brothers were there first, and that every one seemed to have
decided that they had won the day&mdash;in fact no one showed any
curiosity to know what he would bring. As he had <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e2699" title="Source: beat">beaten</span> them by his lustrous
jewels before, they had fancied he would bring something of the same
sort again; so, to conquer him on his own ground, they had sought out
and found two handles of hunting-whips mounted with jewels as sparkling
as those of his drinking-horn. When they saw him come in with the
shabby old whip the Beneficent Cat had given him, they laughed outright
in his face; and the king, in a fit of indignation, ordered him to
leave the hall for venturing to insult him by bringing such a present.
Some laughed him to scorn, and some abused him; but no one would listen
to a word he had to say. At last the tumult was so great that it
reached the queen&rsquo;s ears; and when she had learnt what was the
matter, she insisted that he should have a hearing allowed him.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>When silence had been proclaimed the Grave
Prince said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true, my whip is not so splendid as that of my
brothers, but jewels are out of place on a hunting-whip, it seems to
me; the handle is wanted to be smooth, so that the hand may take a firm
grip of it, rather than to be covered with those points and
unevennesses. The merit of my whip is not in the handle, it is in the
lash, which has such excellent qualities, that you have but to crack
it, and your horse will immediately take you over any obstruction there
may be in your way&mdash;be it a house or a mountain, or what you will.
If you will allow me, I will give you proof of its powers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they all adjourned to the terrace in front of the council-hall,
where was a fine avenue of lofty cypresses; and the queen ordered a
horse to be brought round from the stables. The people had never seen
the prince on horseback before; and when they saw him looking so
gallant, and noble, and determined, they could not forbear cheering
him, till his younger brothers began to fear that his real worth would
soon be found out, and their malice exposed.</p>
<p>Then the prince cracked his whip&mdash;and away went the horse over
the tops of the high trees, seeming to scrape the clouds as he passed.
All the people were lost in admiration, no one had ever seen such a
sight before; and while they were wondering <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>whether it was possible he could have reached
the ground in safety from such a height, there was a murmur in the air,
and they saw him coming back again over the tree-tops. With no more
apparent effort than if he had merely taken a hedge, he came softly to
the ground; and then, kneeling gracefully before his father on one
knee, without a word of boasting or reproach, he laid the clever whip
at his feet.</p>
<p>The king raised him up, and said, aloud to the people, none could
deny that it was this whip that had won the trial, but that as it was
now late, he must leave the ceremony of proclaiming his successor till
the morrow.</p>
<p>All went home for the night, and the old king also went to bed; but
he could not sleep for anxiety, thinking of the anger and
dissatisfaction of his younger sons. And presently, in the silent hour,
they came to him, and said that he must allow them another trial; that
it was impossible they could conceive he meant them to bring him a
fantastical whip of that sort, or of course they would have brought one
which could do much better things. They thought it was the beauty of
the workmanship they had to look to, and so they had provided for
nothing else. They urged their suit so persistently, that the king, who
was now very old and weak, agreed to let them have their way.</p>
<p>Accordingly, next morning he had it proclaimed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>that
the three princes were to make one trial more; and that whichever
brought back the most beautiful and virtuous princess for his wife
should have the crown.</p>
<p>The three princes set out again early the next morning; the two
younger ones providing themselves with jewels and riches, and many
precious things for presents; the eldest taking nothing, but walking
off alone towards the enchanted castle with a heavy heart. &ldquo;It is
all up with me now,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;after all! Why
couldn&rsquo;t my father have been satisfied when I had beaten them
twice? Now I have to kill the Beneficent Cat&mdash;the only being that
ever assisted me; and then I shall have no one to help me at all! They
will come back with two beautiful princesses, and I shall come back
looking like a fool, because no princess will ever come with
<i>me</i>&mdash;and they will take my kingdom, and laugh at me into the
bargain! If it was not for my mother, I would never come back at all;
but it would break her heart if I stayed away, and she is the only one
of them who understands me and cares for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he got nearer the castle, he grew more and more sad. &ldquo;Why
did she make me swear? If it hadn&rsquo;t been for that, I could still
have escaped doing it; but now I cannot break my oath;&rdquo; and he
trudged on.</p>
<p>The gardens looked more lovely than ever. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>scent of the flowers seemed sweeter, and the
melody of the birds more soothing. All was full of harmony&mdash;and he
who had never harmed a fly must cruelly use the soft and beautiful Cat
who had so befriended him!</p>
<p>He passed through the apartments where puss had purred round him so
happily&mdash;the dining-room where they had had their pleasant repast
together&mdash;the boudoir where she had given him such wise
counsel.</p>
<p>At last he came to the kitchen; and there, sure enough, was the Cat
cosily curled round, her soft grey head buried in her long grey
fur.</p>
<p>An energy and daring he had never known before seemed suddenly to
possess him. He took care not to speak, for she had particularly
recommended silence; but, approaching her on tiptoe, seized her rapidly
by her hind-paws before she had time to wake from her pleasant slumber,
and dashed her several times upon the hearth, scarcely knowing what he
did in his horror, till he perceived that he had nothing left in his
hand but the soft, limp, grey fur.</p>
<p>He sank upon the ground in tears, and commenced laying it out
tenderly before him, when he was <span class="corr" id="xd21e2740"
title="Source: woke">woken</span> from his reverie by a mellow ringing
laugh, which made him look up&mdash;and there before him stood the most
beautiful, fairy-like princess that ever was seen on this earth!
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done, kind prince! you have nobly kept your word. And
see what I have gained thereby&mdash;instead of that grey fur, I now
have a form which will perhaps make me meet to fulfil the condition
your father has imposed on you for obtaining your throne!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice, and the glance of her soft eyes, seemed quite familiar to
him&mdash;it was the voice which had first inspired him with hope and
enterprise, and the mild light which had beamed on him when he said he
could be happy to be always near her in her bower. How much more now,
when she appeared in such matchless guise!</p>
<p>He remained kneeling at her feet, and asked her if it was indeed
true that she could love him and be with him always as his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; she replied, raising him up; &ldquo;it is I who
ought to be astonished. I have nothing to refuse, for I owe you all;
and as, but for you, I should still be nothing but a poor grey Cat, I
belong to you, and am absolutely yours. It is I who have to be
astonished, and to ask you if it is possible you who have known me as a
Cat can really love me and regard me as worthy to be indeed your
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mocking me again, I see,&rdquo; he replied;
&ldquo;but you do not really think me so insensible as not to
appreciate your beauty, and the prudence and generosity of which you
have given me such abundant proof? No; if you will come with me,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>I have no fear but that I shall win the trial
this time beyond all possibility of demanding another.&rdquo; He spoke
warmly, and his face beamed with joy. The princess was leaning on his
arm, and looked up in his face as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, now you <i>do</i> look!&mdash;No, I suppose I
mustn&rsquo;t say it now I have no longer my cat-disguise to hide my
blushes,&rdquo; she said, archly; and they passed on into the
reception-hall.</p>
<p>The attendants were no longer invisible. Together with their
mistress they had received their forms and original life; and the
corridors and apartments were filled with her people bustling to serve
her. A banquet was prepared in the dining-hall; and when they had
partaken of it, and had regaled themselves in the bower with happy
talk, the princess reminded the prince&mdash;now no longer
grave&mdash;that it was time for them to be going back to his father. A
great train of carriages and horses were brought round, with mounted
guards and running-footmen, and all the retinue which became a noble
princess.</p>
<p>The princess was carried in a litter by six men in embroidered
liveries, and her ladies with her; and the prince rode on horseback,
close by her side.</p>
<p>This time, though it was near the close of the last day, his
brothers had not appeared when he reached the council-hall. The king
and the queen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>received the Beneficent Princess with smiles and
admiration, and all the people praised her beauty; and the queen
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no fear, my son, that your brothers can demand
another trial this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before she had done speaking, a messenger was hastily ushered into
the hall, covered with dust and stains of travel. He came from the two
younger princes, and had a sorrowful tale to tell.</p>
<p>They had striven to obtain the hands of the princesses of the
neighbouring kingdom; but the king was a prudent sovereign, and
discerned their envious, selfish character. When they found he repulsed
their advances, they had endeavoured to carry off the princesses by
force; but the king had surprised them in the midst of their design,
and had had them shut up as midnight robbers.</p>
<p>The old king was in great distress when he heard the news, for his
sons had manifestly been taken in the midst of wrong-doing, and he
could not defend their acts nor avenge their shame. But the eldest son
took on himself the mission of pacifying the neighbouring sovereign and
delivering his brothers. Having accomplished which, they were fain to
acknowledge that he was not only victor in the trials, but their
deliverer also; and they swore to maintain peace with him, and obey him
as his faithful subjects.</p>
<p>So the old king proclaimed the Grave Prince for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>his
successor, and married him to the Beneficent Princess, amid great
rejoicing of all the people; and the queen had the happiness of seeing
her eldest son acknowledged as the most prudent prince, and the ruler
of the people, and gifted with a beautiful and devoted wife.

<h3 class="main">KLEIN-ELSE.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Passeier-Thal, which at the beginning of the
present century sent Hofer and his famous band of peasant heroes to the
defence of the fatherland, was in ancient times often involved in the
wrangles between its rulers and those of Bavaria. The men of the
Passeier-Thal were no less heroes then than now, but there were heroes
in Bavaria too, so that the success was as often on one side as the
other.</p>
<p>Klein-Else<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2790src" href="#xd21e2790"
name="xd21e2790src">58</a> was the daughter of a bold baron whose
castle was, so to speak, one of the outposts of the valley; and as he
had thus more often than others to bear the brunt of the feud, his
strength became gradually diminished, and it was only by leaguing
himself with his neighbours that he was enabled to repel the frequent
inroads of a turbulent knight who had established himself on the other
side of the old frontier, but who cultivated a strong passion for
annexation. The Passeier-Thal baron did his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>best
to strengthen his defences and keep up a watchful look-out; and the
moment his scouts perceived the enemy advancing, their orders were not
only to bring word of the danger to their master, but to hasten at once
to the other castles of the surrounding heights, and summon their
owners to his support; and then the whole valley immediately bristled
with valiant defenders of their country.</p>
<p>But inasmuch as his adversary was reckless and determined, and much
better provided with men and means, he succeeded in laying his plans so
well at last, that he eluded all the vigilance of the baron&rsquo;s
scattered handful of look-out men, and, bursting in upon his domain by
surprise, carried all his defences, laid waste every thing before him,
and marched upon the castle itself.</p>
<p>The bold baron swore he would not remain to be killed like a reptile
in its hole, but sallied out with the few retainers who remained to
him, to sell his life and his possessions as dearly as he might. With
desperate courage he dealt the deadliest blows around which had been
paid out that day. But it was all in vain. Overcome by superior
numbers, he was brought back but a few hours later in piteous plight,
mortally wounded.</p>
<p>Klein-Else bent over her father with despairing cries; and her tears
fell as fast as the blood from the deep wounds she tried in vain to
staunch. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave the bandage, Klein-Else, it boots not,&rdquo; said the
baron, in tones so slow and faint that she could only catch his words
by putting her ear to his lips; and, as she did so, his cold breath
filled her with horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It boots not to staunch the blood, Klein-Else; my life is
spent. But as you have ever obeyed me, listen now to my word. The enemy
is at the door; you have but time to escape falling into his hands.
Take this key&mdash;it opens a gate of which no one knows the secret.
Count the tenth buttress in the wall, and where the ivy grows thickest,
there, behind it, feel for the lock and open it. Then creep beneath;
and, once on the other side, replace the branches, that no one may see
they have been disturbed. You will see before you three paths: one
leads down into the smiling plain, where you might think to find refuge
in the houses of our people; but another destiny is for you. The second
leads upwards to the thick pine forest, where you might think to lie
concealed till our friends have time to come and rout out this vile
usurper; but another destiny is for you. Take the path straight before
you, that winds round the mountain; though it is open and exposed to
view, fear not, for it leads to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here his voice failed, so that she could no more make out
<i>what</i> he said; and though he continued to exert himself to
complete his directions, it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href=
"#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>was vain that she attempted to
distinguish them. His power of articulation was gone.</p>
<p>Klein-Else threw herself on his cold body, and clung to it with all
her might. But he who had been her guide and guardian, her will, till
now, was powerless and stark; and for all her beseeching he could not
answer.</p>
<p>The chaplain came and raised her up, and they carried the body to
the sanctuary; but Klein-Else, paralyzed with sadness and despair,
stood and gazed after it as though she knew not where she was.</p>
<p>Suddenly wild shouts broke on her ear, and the sound of many feet,
and the tumult of the servants and men-at-arms bidding her fly, for the
enemy had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fly, for the enemy is here!&rdquo; The words recalled her
father&rsquo;s counsel, and mechanically she clasped the key, his last
legacy. Scarcely taking time to change her embroidered garments for a
peasant&rsquo;s attire, she crept along under the wall, counting ten
buttresses, with a beating heart. After the tenth, she put her hand
through the thick ivy, and felt, as her father had foretold, the iron
bosses of the lock. It required all her strength to turn the key; but
this accomplished, there was safety and rest behind the ivy&rsquo;s
faithful veil.</p>
<p>It was but just in time; the rough soldiers were close behind.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! who went there?&rdquo; she heard a hoarse voice say, as
she noiselessly closed the door. &ldquo;Saw you not the ivy move? Press
through and see who passed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was but a frightened hare&mdash;I saw it run,&rdquo; said
another, with a less terrible voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing taller ever passed that branch,&rdquo; said another;
and the speakers passed out of hearing.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>There lay the three paths: the one straight on before&mdash;but so
open, so exposed, any one who happened to be passing for miles round
might have seen and pursued her, while either of the others offered
instant cover and security. Klein-Else was sorely tempted to try one of
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had heard <i>all</i> his instructions,&rdquo; she
reasoned, &ldquo;it would have been different: I would then have done
<i>all</i> he told me, whithersoever it might have led; but now I know
not what he meant. I may go a little way along this path&mdash;and
<i>then</i> what shall I do? Maybe, I shall fall into a greater danger
than that from which he would have saved me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she turned to seek the shelter of the friendly cottages in the
valley beneath. But the words seemed to live in the air around
her,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another destiny is for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trembling and confused, she would have plunged into the hiding-place
of the pine-forest above; but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163"
href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>the wind that moaned through
their lofty branches seemed charged with the words,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another destiny is for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was thus impelled forward into the open path; and, creeping
close to the mountain-side, she now pursued her way along it. It was
with no small relief that she noticed the sun was nearly sinking behind
the opposite heights, so that soon she might hope to be safe from the
gaze of men.</p>
<p>And yet, as darkness fell around, it became but the source of other
fears. And the sense of her loneliness and abandonment took away her
courage to proceed any farther.</p>
<p>She leant against the rock for support, and her tears fell fast and
warm upon its stony side&mdash;piteously enough, you might have
thought, to move and melt it.</p>
<p>And so it was! for see! the hard rock yielded and made way before
the noble form of a knight in armour, who said, with compassionate
voice,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maiden, wherefore these tears?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because my father is dead, and his enemies have taken his
castle, and I have no shelter and nothing to eat!&rdquo; sobbed
Klein-Else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is all,&rdquo; answered the noble knight, &ldquo;it
is easily made straight.&rdquo; And with that he turned to the rock,
and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open, hoary rock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the hoary rock opened, and disclosed a treasure <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>of
every imaginable kind of riches stored around&mdash;jewels and coin,
and shining armour, and dazzling dresses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this is yours, Klein-Else,&rdquo; said the knight;
&ldquo;you have but to take what you will, when you will. It will never
grow less. You have only to say, &lsquo;Open, hoary rock!&rsquo; and
these treasures will always appear at your bidding. Dispose of them as
you like; only make a good use of them, for on that depends all your
future happiness. I will come and see you again in seven years, and I
shall see what use you have made of my gift; but you must remember my
name, or woe will be to you.&rdquo; So he whispered his name in her
ear, and disappeared.</p>
<p>Klein-Else was so dazzled and startled that she hardly knew what to
think, or whether what had happened was a dream or reality. To make
sure, she said to the rock, &ldquo;Open, hoary rock!&rdquo; and the
rock opened at her bidding as quickly as at the knight&rsquo;s, and
disclosed its glittering treasure. But it was still hard to decide all
at once what to take of it; and knowing that it was in a secure
store-house, and that it was dangerous to burden herself with much
riches when travelling alone in the dark night, she only took a few
pieces of money&mdash;enough to pay for food and lodging&mdash;and
passed on with a lightened heart. The rock closed up as she went
farther&mdash;but she took a note of the spot, so that she <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>might be sure to know it again; and then made
for the lights which appeared with friendly radiance at no great
distance through the trees which now fringed the road, repeating the
name of the knight to herself, as she went along, that she might never
forget it.</p>
<p>Klein-Else hasted on, but was rather dismayed to find that the
lights were the lights of a great castle where her money would be of no
use. She could not ask for a lodging and supper for money <i>there</i>,
and there was no other habitation near. So she put by her money again,
and, with the humility befitting her wayworn aspect and lowly attire,
begged the great man&rsquo;s servants to give her some poor employment
by which she might earn a place among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can a little, dirty, ragged girl like you do?&rdquo;
said the cook, who was just occupied in fixing the spit through a young
chamois that looked so succulent and tender, one as hungry as
Klein-Else might have eaten it as it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do whatever you please to tell me,&rdquo; answered
Klein-Else, timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A proper answer,&rdquo; replied the cook. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
see if you can watch the poultry-house, then. You must be up by
daybreak and go late to bed, and lie in the straw over the
poultry-loft, and keep half awake all night to scare away the foxes, if
any come; and if one smallest chicken is lost, woe betide you! you will
be whipped and sent away. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href=
"#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>Here is a piece of dry bread for
your supper. Now go, and don&rsquo;t stand idling about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Klein-Else was so hungry that she gladly took the piece of dry black
bread, and went to try to sleep on the straw in the poultry-loft. She
had to get up at daybreak, when the cock crew; and she had to keep her
eye on the brood all day; and late at night she had a piece of dry
black bread for supper, and was sent to sleep in the straw of the
poultry-loft. Her only pastime was to recall the memory of her treasure
in the rock, and repeat over and over again the knight&rsquo;s name,
that she might be sure never to forget it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of what use is all my fine treasure,&rdquo; she mused,
&ldquo;if I am never to be any thing but a wretched
Hennenpf&ouml;sl<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2901src" href="#xd21e2901"
name="xd21e2901src">59</a>? And what can I do? if I come out with
handfuls of gold and fine clothes, they will take me for a thief or a
witch, and I shall be worse off than now; and if I show them the
treasure, who knows but they will take it from me? The knight said my
happiness depended on the use I made of it, yet I can make <i>no</i>
use of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she sat and counted the hens and chickens, and repeated the
knight&rsquo;s name, and ate her dry black bread, and slept in the
straw in the poultry-loft.</p>

</div>
<p>At last Sunday came, and the glad church bells rang merrily,
flinging their joyous notes all abroad; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb167" href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>and the servants of
the castle put on their best clothes to go to church. But how could
Klein-Else be seen among them, all in their snow-white linen and
bright-coloured ribbons&mdash;Klein-Else, the Hennenpf&ouml;sl, with
her poor rags?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, at last, I can use my treasury,&rdquo; she said to
herself; &ldquo;I can at least get some of the pretty clothes that hang
there, and go to church.&rdquo; So she washed herself in the
mountain-torrent, and braided her dishevelled hair in massive golden
braids, and crept round to the rock, and bid it open,
saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open, hoary rock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of all the treasures it instantly disclosed, she saw none but one
beautiful garment all woven out of sunbeams and glittering with jewels
of morning dew. Having put this on, and once more looking like a
baron&rsquo;s daughter, she made haste to reach the church.</p>
<p>The holy office had already begun, and the church was crowded right
out into the porch. But when the people saw such a dazzling sight, they
all made way for the lady in the shining apparel, none dreaming of
Klein-Else. Now the only part of the church where there was any room
was at the baron&rsquo;s bench. For he was a young lord, and had
neither mother, sister, nor wife; and all the places reserved for his
family were vacant. Klein-Else, moving on till she could find where to
kneel, had thus to come and kneel by him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb168" href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span></p>
<p>The young baron was as much dazzled at the sight as Klein-Else
herself had been at the treasures in the rock, and at every pause in
the service he could do nothing but fix his gaze on her. As soon as it
was over, however, Klein-Else glided out softly, and hasting back to
the rock, hung the sunbeam-dress up again; and once more assuming her
rags, hid herself in the poultry-loft, almost frightened at what she
had done.</p>
<p>All the next week she had new subjects of thought. She felt sure the
young baron had looked at her and admired her; and wasn&rsquo;t it more
meet that she, a baron&rsquo;s daughter, should be kneeling by the side
of the young baron than sleeping in the poultry-loft, a mere
Hennenpf&ouml;sl? Ah, if <i>that</i> came true&mdash;if the young baron
married her; <i>then</i> she would have some one to tell her good
fortune to&mdash;some one to defend her treasure. Then she could make
the good use of it the knight had manifestly intended. She could wipe
away the tears of all those who went without shelter, as she had once;
every desolate orphan who had none to defend her; every poor
Hennenpf&ouml;sl, the drudge of the menials. &ldquo;How strange,&rdquo;
she said to herself, &ldquo;there should be people blessed with
friends, and riches, and enjoyments, who live full of their own
happiness, and who have no thought for the forsaken and the outcast!
She would never be like them, not she! <i>her</i> happiness should be
in making others happy.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169"
href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span></p>
<p>But, in the meantime, was she sure the baron had looked at her
otherwise than out of curiosity? Was he really interested in her? and
if he was, would he continue to care for her when he found she was only
a Hennenpf&ouml;sl? She must put him to the test; and she sat and
thought how to arrange this. This was subject enough for thought; and
this week was at an end only too soon.</p>
<p>The next Sunday came; and when the church bells rang, Klein-Else ran
to her rock, took out of her store this time a garment woven out of
moonbeams, and having arranged her luxuriant hair in massive tresses,
once more proceeded to the church. But with all the haste she had made,
she could not arrive before the holy office had begun, and the church
was once more full. The people fell back again, in awe of her shining
garments, and made way for her to kneel beside the baron, who could
scarcely suppress a gesture of delight at beholding her once again. Nor
did his joy escape Klein-Else&rsquo;s observation; and many a blushing
glance they exchanged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a noble cavalier!&rdquo; thought Klein-Else; &ldquo;and
just such a one as my father always told me my husband should
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a lovely maiden!&rdquo; mused the young baron;
&ldquo;where can she have sprung from? Is she of earth or
heaven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All that last week, while Klein-Else was thinking <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>of
him, he had been thinking still more of her; and had ordered his
waiting-men to surround her as she came out of church, and beg her to
come to him at the castle. But Klein-Else had no idea of suffering
herself to be so easy a prize; so she fled so fast the baron&rsquo;s
men could hardly approach her. And when at last she found they were
gaining upon her, and that her fleet step availed her not, she threw
down the pieces of money which she took the first night from the rock;
and while they stopped to pick them up, pursued her way unperceived,
and let the rock close on her till they had lost the trace. Then,
assuming her poor rags once more, she returned silently to her
poultry-loft.</p>
<p>Her thoughts had food enough now; but it was less with the poor
orphans she was to console, than with the young baron, and how to test
his love, that they were occupied.</p>
<p>Next Sunday she chose a garment blue like the sky, and all
sparkling, as with living stars. She presented herself at the church,
and found herself again placed beside the young baron. At the end of
the service she went out quickly, as before, only this time he
contrived, as she rose to leave, to seize her hand, and slip a gold
ring on her finger. Nevertheless, Klein-Else slipped out through the
midst of the congregation, and though the serving-men had had stringent
orders to follow her, she had prudently provided herself with gold
pieces <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>enough to disperse the whole lot of them while
she escaped.</p>
<p>The young baron sat alone in his castle, as he had sat this
fortnight past, taking no notice of any one, but as if his whole soul
was wrapt up in the fair apparition, and he was in despair, since her
hiding-place could not be traced. He sat nursing his grief, and could
neither be distracted from it, nor comforted. His friends sent for the
most famous physicians of the country to attend him, but none of them
could do any thing for his case; and daily he grew paler and gloomier,
and none could help him. At last the Gr&auml;fin Jaufenstein, his aunt,
came and insisted that some amusement must be found to divert him; but
the young baron refused every proposal, till at last she begged him to
give a great banquet, to which every one from far and near should be
invited, every kind of game and every kind of costly diet should be
afforded, and nothing spared to make it the most magnificent banquet
ever given. To the great surprise and delight of all, he consented to
this; but it was because it occurred to him that inviting the whole
country, the chances were that the beautiful maiden of his choice, who
yet hid herself so persistently from him, might once more mysteriously
appear before him too: so he gave his aunt the Countess Jaufenstein
free leave to give what orders she liked, and go to what expense she
liked, only providing that she should <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>have the invitations
publicly published, so that there might be every chance of their
reaching the ears of the mysterious maiden.</p>
<p>At last the day of the banquet came, and there was a running hither
and thither in the baron&rsquo;s castle, with the preparations, such as
can be better imagined than described. The guests swarmed in the halls,
and the servants in the kitchen; and Klein-Else, creeping up from her
poultry-loft, could hardly make her way up to the fire where the cook
was preparing all manner of deliciously scented dishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what ails the things!&rdquo; cried the
cook; &ldquo;these pancakes are the only thing the baron will eat, and,
as fate will have it, I cannot turn one of them to-night! Three and
thirty years I have made pancakes in this castle, and never did I fail
before to-night&mdash;to-night, when it is most important of
all!&rdquo; and she poured another into the pan. But as she did so,
with a hand trembling with anxiety, the oil ran over the side of the
pan, and the great heat of the stove set it on fire, so that a great
flame curled over the pancake&mdash;and there was nothing left of it
but a black, misshapen mass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! oh, dear! what <i>shall</i> I do?&rdquo; cried the
cook; &ldquo;there is not one of the whole lot fit to send up, and if
this dish is not the best, I had just as lief I had prepared no dish at
all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I have a try, friend cook?&rdquo; said Klein-Else,
coaxingly. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i>, indeed!&rdquo; screamed the cook, indignation and
envy added to her former despair; &ldquo;and a little, dirty, ragged,
misbegotten starveling&mdash;a vagabond&mdash;a Hennenpf&ouml;sl like
you, who never saw a kitchen, or a stove, or a frying-pan, or any thing
else! to suppose that <i>you</i> can turn a pancake, when <i>I</i>, who
have turned pancakes in this castle for three and thirty years, have
failed! A likely matter indeed! What is the world coming to? Begone,
with your impudence, and mind your hens! Ah! now I think of it, I
believe it is you that have bewitched the eggs, and <i>that&rsquo;s</i>
why the pancakes won&rsquo;t turn! Begone, I say, out of my kitchen,
and out of the poultry-house too&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have no more of your
tricks with my eggs!&rdquo; and she turned, with a menacing gesture at
Klein-Else, to try her luck once more.</p>
<p>But at the sight of the black mass in the frying-pan, she grew
fairly discouraged, and throwing herself down in a chair, wrapt her
face in her apron, and wept like a child.</p>
<p>Meantime Klein-Else advanced with light step to the stove, took up
the frying-pan, and cleaned it out in a trice, then poured fresh oil
into it, and held it over the stove till it boiled; then, while it
spluttered cheerily, she deftly poured in the batter, gliding into it
the ring which the baron had stealthily put on her hand at church, and
along with it, one with a magnificent diamond, which she had taken from
her treasury in the rock. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href=
"#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span></p>
<p>The boiling oil danced and chirped merrily round the cake, the
batter rose as batter never rose before; and when Klein-Else shifted it
lightly on to the dish, it wore a bright, golden hue, matched only by
her own radiant hair.</p>
<p>The cook, waking from her stupor, was in a transport of delight at
beholding the effect of her skill, and sent the dish at once to the
baron&rsquo;s table, while Klein-Else took her place in an
out-of-the-way corner to hear what should befall.</p>
<p>Nor had she long to wait. The dish had not been gone ten minutes,
when the baron&rsquo;s body-servant came solemnly into the kitchen,
with the announcement that the baron demanded the immediate attendance
of the cook. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because I kept him waiting for the
pancakes, and because the one of that little hussey&rsquo;s making is
not so good as those I have made for him all his life, and his father
before him;&rdquo; and, all trembling and afraid, she rose to follow
his messenger. Espying Klein-Else watching anxiously behind a pillar as
she passed along, she could not forbear calling out to her, &ldquo;Ah,
wretched child, it is you have got me into this scrape! But you shall
pay for it! Why did I let you touch the frying-pan! Why did I let you
enter the castle! You had better not come under my sight any more, or
I&rsquo;ll soon show you where the builder made the hole in the
wall<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3006src" href="#xd21e3006" name=
"xd21e3006src">60</a>!&rdquo; and she dragged herself along
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>slowly, in great fear of the apprehended
displeasure of the baron, but comforting herself with the determination
to let him know the whole fault lay with the Hennenpf&ouml;sl.</p>
<p>Great was her surprise, however, to find that it was with no
intention of chiding that the baron had summoned her. On the contrary,
the gloomy cloud his brow had lately worn had disappeared; he not only
looked gay and joyous as of old, but a special radiance of pleasurable
expectation lit up his countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, cook,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have made me good
pancakes all my life, but never one like this! Now tell me honestly who
made this one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, but if it is so, I may as well have the credit of
it,&rdquo; thought the cook; &ldquo;and, after all, I <i>did</i> make
the batter, and that&rsquo;s the chief part of the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I made it myself, baron, upon my soul! no one but myself
makes any thing for the high table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The baron&rsquo;s countenance fell. He began to look gloomy and
disappointed once more&mdash;was the clue to escape him after all? He
roused himself again, as with one flash of hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did no one help you to make it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;If I tell that she had any part in it, it is obvious, from
the tone he takes, he will give the whole merit to her. No, I&rsquo;ll
not mention her; and besides, she didn&rsquo;t help me to <i>make</i>
it.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, baron, it don&rsquo;t want two people to make a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>pancake! I&rsquo;ve always made pancakes for
this castle these three and thirty years without help;&rdquo; and she
tried to talk as if she felt hurt, and thus bring the conversation to
an end.</p>
<p>The baron passed his hand roughly across his forehead, and stamped
his foot in despair.</p>
<p>Once more a hopeful thought flashed across his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These rings! tell me, how did they get into the pancake, if
you made it?&rdquo; he exclaimed, in peremptory accents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those rings? I never saw those rings before,&rdquo; stammered
the cook, beginning to get a little confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you mutter as you passed the Hennenpf&ouml;sl
coming along, about it&rsquo;s being all her fault, and making her
suffer for it?&rdquo; interposed the body-servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! said she so?&rdquo; cried the baron. &ldquo;Speak, woman,
what meant you by those words? Beware, and speak the truth this time,
for it is matter of terrible consequence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who ever would have thought such a fuss would come of turning
a pancake!&rdquo; thought the cook to herself; but she said out aloud,
&ldquo;Well, it is true, the Hennenpf&ouml;sl did hold the frying-pan
while it was on the stove; I didn&rsquo;t know it was worth while to
mention that. But what could <i>she</i> have to do with the beautiful
rings?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied the servant, &ldquo;that can have
nothing to do with it, as you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; replied the baron, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so clear
of that. Let the Hennenpf&ouml;sl, as you call her, be brought here,
and let&rsquo;s see what account she has to give of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s impossible; she isn&rsquo;t even a servant of
the house. She is a little whining beggar brat, that I took in scarce
three weeks ago and put in the poultry-loft, to keep her from
starving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three weeks!&rdquo; exclaimed the baron; &ldquo;said you
three weeks? Let her be brought to me instantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she isn&rsquo;t fit to come into your presence;
she&rsquo;s grimed with dirt, and covered in rags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reason not, but send her hither,&rdquo; said the baron, his
energy returning as his hopes kindled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she is the maiden to whom I gave the ring, she is of no
low birth: there is some mystery which I must penetrate. If she were
nothing but a &lsquo;Hennenpf&ouml;sl,&rsquo; whence could she have had
this brilliant ring, which puts mine to shame?&rdquo; he mused within
himself, as he waited impatiently for the maiden of his dreams to
appear.</p>
<p>Klein-Else, meantime, had made no doubt that since the baron had
sent for the cook, his wisdom would enable him to discover that she
must be sent for next, and had accordingly repaired to her treasury in
the rock, and had taken thence a resplendent attire. It was no longer
now the simple gifts of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href=
"#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span>nature which furnished her
wardrobe; she was decked as became a baron&rsquo;s daughter, with all
the resources of the milliner and the jeweller&rsquo;s art. Cavaliers
and ladies-in-waiting walked beside her, and twenty pages dressed in
pink and white satin, with plumed bonnets, carried her train behind,
while men in rich liveries, bearing torches, ran by the side of the
procession.</p>
<p>Gr&auml;fin Jaufenstein was at the head of the hall welcoming the
guests, and doing the honours of the castle, to supply what the moody
humour of its lord left lacking in courtesy. But while she courtesied
to noble lords and ladies with queenly grace, and, with imperceptible
asides, at the same time gave directions that every one should have his
due place, and that every thing should proceed with the due order of
etiquette, it never for a moment escaped her practised eye that
something unusual was going on in the neighbourhood of the young baron.
That he should summon the cook to his presence, probably to chide her
justly for some breach of the rules of her art, if such had befallen,
was indeed no unreasonable distraction for the baron&rsquo;s
melancholy, and she hailed it as a token of returning interest in the
ordinary affairs of life, which had occupied him so little of late; but
when she heard him order the Hennenpf&ouml;sl to be brought there in
the midst of his guests, she thought it time to interfere&mdash;it
became a matter of eccentricity passing all bounds. Dexterously
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>excusing her momentary absence from her guests,
she accordingly made her way up to her nephew, preparing to wrap up her
remonstrance in her most honeyed language, so as better to convince
without provoking him. Before she could reach his chair, there was a
movement of astonishment in the vast assembly, and a cry of admiration,
while the heralds proclaimed,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Place for the most noble baron&rsquo;s daughter!&rdquo; And
then, surrounded by her shining crowd of attendants, and glittering in
her jewelled robes, Klein-Else made her way with modest, but at the
same time noble carriage towards the young baron.</p>
<p>The young baron recognized her the moment the tapestry was raised
for her to pass, and instantly went forth to meet her with courteous
gestures, and led her up to the seat next his own at the banquet.</p>
<p>The stately countess looked on a little perplexed, for the first
time in her life, but with admirable serenity and self-possession
inquired the name of the fair guest who did their poor banquet the
honour of attending it in so great state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the poor Hennenpf&ouml;sl, madame, whom your noble
nephew has done the honour to summon to his presence; and I hope you
will not think I disgrace his command,&rdquo; replied Klein-Else, with
a reverence at once lowly and full of accomplished dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Hennenpf&ouml;sl!&rdquo; repeated the countess, returning
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>the salute mechanically. &ldquo;But surely there
is some mistake&mdash;some&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dearest countess, some mystery there is,&rdquo;
interposed her nephew; &ldquo;but we will not seek to penetrate it till
it shall please the lady herself to reveal it. Why she should have
chosen to pass some time as the Hennenpf&ouml;sl, I know not; but this
is not the first time we have met, and I am sufficiently satisfied of
her grace and discretion to know that for whatever reason she chose it,
she chose aright. I have further determined this very night to lay
myself and my fortune at her feet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Klein-Else started, with a little cry of satisfied expectation, then
coloured modestly and looked down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the lady will at least favour us with her name?&rdquo;
urged the countess, but half satisfied. Klein-Else turned to her
chamberlain with dignity, and whispered an order; and then the
chamberlain stood forward and proclaimed aloud the names and titles of
the deceased baron of the Passeier-Thal, her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the lady, in a tone of disparagement,
&ldquo;methinks his was a fortune which could scarcely be united with
that of my nephew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Countess!&rdquo; exclaimed the young baron, furious at the
suggestion; but before he could proceed the chamberlain once more
intervened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There need be no difficulty on that score,&rdquo; he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>said; and he made a sign to the attendants who
were behind. They came up in brave order, two and two, each pair
bearing a casket in which was a thousand crowns. &ldquo;A thousand such
caskets contain the dowry of the baron&rsquo;s daughter; and she has
priceless jewels without number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A million crowns!&rdquo; echoed the whole assembly, in
chorus; &ldquo;was there ever such a fortune known?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The countess was absolutely speechless, and turned to participate in
the astonishment of her guests.</p>
<p>The young baron and Klein-Else, thus left to each other&rsquo;s
conversation, were not slow in confessing their mutual love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now all our friends are gathered round us,&rdquo; he
exclaimed, at last, &ldquo;what better time to proclaim our happiness?
My friends! I present you the fair lady who has consented to become my
bride!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a general sound of jubilation and praise. All gathered
round to felicitate the baron, and the minstrels sang the charms of the
bride.</p>
<p>The baron begged them all to stay with him ten days, to celebrate
the nuptials. And for ten days there was revelry and rapture, singing
and merry-making; and when at last the guests returned home, every one
carried back to his own neighbourhood the tale of the surpassing
beauty, riches, and grace of Klein-Else. Every body had been won by
her, there was no dissentient opinion; and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>even
Gr&auml;fin Jaufenstein acknowledged that her nephew could not have
made a nobler or better choice.</p>
<p>When they were left alone, the days seemed hardly long enough to
tell their love. Never was there happiness equal to theirs. Before the
guests left, the baron had invited them all to come back every year on
the anniversary; and every year, as they gathered round, they found
them more and more wrapt in each other&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>On the second anniversary they found that their happiness had been
increased by the birth of an heir; and the next year there was a little
daughter too, the delight of her parents. Year by year the children
grew in beauty, and grace, and intelligence, and others were added to
their numbers. And every one envied the unequalled happiness of the
baron and baroness.</p>
<p>Meantime the years were passing away, though Klein-Else had taken no
account of them. To her it was one continual round of enjoyment,
uncrossed by any care; each season had its own joys, and she revelled
in the fresh variety of each, but counted them not as they passed.</p>
<p>One day they sat together under a shady grove: the baron was weaving
a chaplet of roses, Klein-Else was fondling her latest-born upon her
knee; round them sported their little ones, bringing fresh baskets of
roses for the chaplet the baron was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb183" href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>weaving for
Klein-Else; while Otto the heir, a noble boy who promised to reproduce
his father&rsquo;s stately figure and handsome lineaments, rejoiced
them by his prowess with his bow and arrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How the time has sped, Klein-Else!&rdquo; whispered the
baron; &ldquo;it seems but yesterday that you first came and knelt
beside me in your sunbeam garment. Then, just as now, it was happiness
to feel you beside me. I knew not who was there, but as I heard the
flutter of your drapery a glow of joy seemed to come from its shining
folds, and I, who had never loved any one else, loved you from that
moment as I love you now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How well you say it, love!&rdquo; responded Klein-Else.
&ldquo;Yes; where is the difference between to-day and yesterday, and
last year and the year before that? Ever since that first day it has
been one long love, nothing else! Yes; well I remember that day. I was
poor, and despised, and had no one to talk to, and never thought any
one would ever look at me again&mdash;except to scold me. And then I
went into the church and knelt by you; and I felt as the new ivy twig
must feel when it has crept and tossed about in vain, and then at last
finds, close under its grasp, the strong, immovable oak, and clasps
it&mdash;clasps it never to loose its hold again, never! but grows up
clasping it ever closer and closer, till it grows quite one with it,
and no one can separate them any more for ever!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the baron; &ldquo;nothing can separate
them any more&mdash;nothing can separate us now! We have grown together
for years, and have only grown the closer. It is now&mdash;let me
see&mdash;five, six, <i>seven</i> years, and we have only grown the
closer to each other! To think it is <i>seven</i> years! no, it wants a
few weeks; but it will soon be seven years. Seven&mdash;&rdquo; he
turned to look at her, for he perceived that as he spoke she had
loosened her hold of him, and now he saw she was pale and
trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what ails you, Elschen<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3147src" href="#xd21e3147" name="xd21e3147src">61</a>? Elschen
dear! speak to me, Elschen!&rdquo; he added, with anxiety, for she sank
back almost unconscious against the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be better presently,&rdquo; stammered the baroness.
&ldquo;I think the scent of the flowers is too powerful. I don&rsquo;t
feel quite well&mdash;take me down by the side of the water; I shall be
better presently.&rdquo; An attendant took the babe from her
arms&mdash;and the baron remembered afterwards, that as she parted from
it she embraced it with a passionate flood of tears; then he led her to
the side of the stream, and bathed her burning forehead in the cooling
flood.</p>
<p>Suddenly voices in angry altercation were heard through the trees,
and the servants summoned the baron with excited gesticulations, saying
there was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>a strange knight, all in armour, who claimed to
see the baroness.</p>
<p>Klein-Else was near fainting again when she heard them say that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Claims to see the baroness, say you?&rdquo; replied their
lord, with menacing gesture. &ldquo;Where is he? Let him say that to
<i>me</i>!&rdquo; and he darted off to meet him, without listening to
the faint words Klein-Else strove to utter.</p>
<p>Now she was left alone by the side of the stream where, as the
Hennenpf&ouml;sl, she had first washed away the stains of servitude and
dressed herself to meet him who was to teach her to love. It was beside
that stream she had sat, and her tears had mingled with it, as she had
vowed that if ever such joy was hers as now she owned, her treasure
should be for those who were outcast and suffering as she had been, and
her happiness should be in making others happy!</p>
<p>How had she fulfilled her vow? From that time to this it had passed
out of her mind. Filled with her own gratification, she had left the
orphan in her bereavement, the suffering in their misery, nor stretched
out a helping hand.</p>
<p>The seven years were spent, and there was no doubt the knight was
come to seek an account of the treasure he had entrusted to her. She
had not only to meet him with shame for its misuse, but even his name
she had forgotten! And he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href=
"#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>had said, &ldquo;Woe be to you, if
you have forgotten that name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she <i>had</i> forgotten it. She pressed her hands against her
throbbing temples as if to force it from her brain, and swept away the
mantling hair&mdash;if but the cool breeze might waft it back to her!
But the forgotten name came not.</p>
<p>Suddenly the knight stood before her, and terrible he was to look at
in his shining armour! As she saw him she screamed and swooned
away.</p>
<p>But he touched her, and bade her rise, then beckoned her to follow
him; and she could not choose but obey. He led her over the stream and
along the path in the mountain-side where the trees fringed the way;
and when they reached the rock she knew so well, with its treasury
whence all her means of happiness had been derived, he said in solemn
accents,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open, hoary rock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But to her he said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she could not choose but look. But oh, horror! in place of the
coin and jewels, armour and apparel, it was filled with wasted forms
bowed with misery and distress! the tear-worn orphan, the neglected
sick. Here she saw lying a youth, wan and emaciated, struck down in all
the promise of boyhood, and his mother tore her hair in agony by his
side. And there stood a father, gaunt and grey, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>vainly grappling with Hunger, who was stealing
away his children one by one from before his face.
Here&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>But she could bear no more. She sank upon the ground, and hid her
face for very shame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ransom of <i>these</i>, it is, you have spent upon
yourself!&rdquo; thundered the pitiless knight; and every word was a
death-knell....</p>
<p>The baron and his servants continued their search for the unknown
knight, but for long they found him not; one said he had seen him go
this way, and another that. Till at last an artless peasant maiden told
them she had seen him take the path of the mountain, across the stream,
and the baroness following behind with weak and unsteady steps. The
baron hasted his steps to pursue the way she pointed.</p>
<p>But he only found the lifeless body of Klein-Else kneeling against
the hoary rock! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188"

<h3 class="main">PRINCE RADPOT<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3213src"
href="#xd21e3213" name="xd21e3213src">62</a>.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Radpot succeeded early to the throne of his fathers.
When on his deathbed, his sire had called him to his side, and said to
him, &ldquo;In leaving you my kingdom, I leave you a counsel with it
which is worth the kingdom itself. In all things be guided by the
advice of my wise counsellor Rathgeb, and you shall do well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Radpot had a stepmother who hated him, and was determined to
destroy him if possible; so she devised a plot against him, the first
step of which was to get him out of the kingdom. She therefore advised
that he should take a year&rsquo;s journey to perfect himself in
knowledge of the world, before assuming the reins of government.</p>
<p>Radpot was not devoid of shrewdness, and readily <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>suspecting some evil intention in his
stepmother&rsquo;s advice, at first resisted following it; but
afterwards, submitting the matter to Rathgeb, according to his
father&rsquo;s desire, he received from him a different counsel from
that which he had expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though your stepmother may have evil intentions,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;you need not therefore be afraid; we shall be able to
baffle them. In the meantime, it is well that you should travel to see
the world, and learn experience. We will so establish a council of
regency that the queen shall not be able to do great mischief during
your absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Radpot was nothing loath to follow this advice, as he was of an
adventurous disposition; so, all things being ordered for the due
conduct of the affairs of the kingdom, he set out with Rathgeb for his
year&rsquo;s journey.</p>
<p>During all the days of preparation for the journey, the queen, who
had always heretofore shown herself harsh and hostile to Radpot,
behaved with the utmost tenderness and devotion, which the young prince
ascribed to her satisfaction at his having followed her advice, and
returned her advances with an ingenuous cordiality. She, in turn,
received his deference with an increase of solicitude, and nothing
could be more affectionate than their leave-taking. Every thing the
thoughtfulness of a fond mother could have suggested was provided by
her for his safety and comfort on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb190" href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>journey; and as he
had his foot in the stirrup she still had one more token of her care of
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take this vial,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is a precious
cordial; and when you are worn and wearied with heat and travel, a few
drops of its precious contents will suffice to restore you to strength
and vigour. Farewell! and when you taste of it, think of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Radpot, with all the openness of his generous nature, assured her
that he should never forget her kindness for him, and stowing away the
vial in his belt, waved his hand to her as he rode away.</p>
<p>Two days and two nights Radpot and his trusty counsellor journeyed
through the cool forest; and then for another day along its border,
exposed to the heat of the sun upon the mountain-sides, till they came
to a vast plain where there was no shelter of hill or tree, no
hospitality of human dwelling. With unbroken courage, however, the
young prince commenced crossing it. It was only when, after three
days&rsquo; more hard riding, they still seemed as far as ever from a
place of rest, that, wearied and dispirited, he took out his
stepmother&rsquo;s vial, to try the effect of her cordial.</p>
<p>It was the moment Rathgeb had feared. He had observed how completely
the queen had lulled Radpot&rsquo;s suspicions, and that every attempt
at suggesting there was any hypocrisy in her conduct had appeared to
vex him. To have now spoken of any danger in trying her cordial would
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>probably have provoked his
resentment&mdash;Rathgeb took another way of saving his charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think you not our mounts deserve more than we to taste this
precious restorative? whatever labour we have endured, theirs has been
tenfold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the good-natured prince; and, dismounting,
he opened the mouth of his steed, and poured some drops of the liquid
on his tongue. He had scarcely done so, however, when the poor beast
stretched out his long neck with an air of agony, then fell over on its
side, and expired!</p>
<p>Rathgeb left the incident to produce its own effect on the mind of
his pupil, who stood gazing as one bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can it be that killed my good horse?&rdquo; he
exclaimed, at length; &ldquo;it could not be the cordial! no, never!
the queen could not have been so base! It was, that he has been so long
unused to exercise, this terrible journey has overcome him, and the
cordial was too late to save him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try it on mine,&rdquo; answered Rathgeb; &ldquo;he is a
battle-charger, used to endurance, and delighting in labour.
See,&rdquo; he said, jumping to the ground, and patting his neck,
&ldquo;he is as fresh now as when we started, not a hair
turned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; replied Radpot, not without some asperity.
&ldquo;I would not suffer the trial, could I suspect it possible the
queen could be capable of so horrible a plot as you evidently suppose;
but I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>cannot believe it&mdash;so give the cordial to
your horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rathgeb took the vial, and poured not more than three drops on the
tongue of his thirsty beast. Both watched the effect with a tension
akin to awe.</p>
<p>In the first few moments no change was apparent, but Radpot was too
generous to give utterance to the triumph he began to experience.</p>
<p>Suddenly the faithful beast started as if it had been transfixed
with the sharpest arrow, directed one piteous look towards the master
it had served so well, and fell down lifeless by the side of its
companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt it is as you say,&rdquo; Radpot now
confessed, at once. &ldquo;Forgive me for the haste with which I
spoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, prince, there is no need of excuse. Though it behoved me
to stand on guard and see no harm befell you, it became you to trust
her whose duty it was to befriend, not to harm you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now try this cordial of <i>mine</i>, maybe it will fulfil
what the other promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince gladly accepted the proffered gift; and both, wonderfully
restored by its effects, continued their journey on foot.</p>
<p>They had not gone far when three ravens passed them on the wing. The
prince and his companion turned back to watch their flight, and saw
them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>alight on the carrion of their dead horses,
immediately after tasting of which they all three fell to the earth
dead, by the side of the dead horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be some profit to be gained from these,&rdquo; said
Rathgeb; and going back to the spot, he picked up the dead ravens and
took them with him.</p>
<p>Their journey was without further incident, till they at last espied
a welcome hut completely sheltered in the border of a vast stretch of
forest land.</p>
<p>The sight gave them courage for renewed exertion; and in a few
minutes more they stood before the door. An old woman came out to ask
them in, but observing the youth and noble mien of the prince, she
seemed to be moved with compassion, and cried out, with great
earnestness, entreating them not to come in, for the place was the
resort of a band of twelve robbers, and that no one could deliver them
out of their hands. They would not be home till the next day for
dinner; in the meantime, by a path she indicated, the travellers could
easily make good their escape.</p>
<p>The prince would have rewarded her for her advice, and have set out
again to find a safer shelter; but Rathgeb remarked to him, that a
prince should rather find means to overcome a danger than fly from it,
and promised to carry him through this one, if he would be guided by
him. Radpot, mindful of his father&rsquo;s desire, promised to do all
he proposed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, when the robbers come in, do exactly as I do,&rdquo;
said Rathgeb; &ldquo;in the meantime keep up your courage.&rdquo; And
so they supped on what the old woman set before them, and went to bed
and slept peacefully. The next day, an hour before dinner-time, Rathgeb
went into the kitchen and handed the three ravens to the old woman to
cook, giving her very particular directions as to the sauces that were
to accompany it, as if it were a dish for which they had a particular
liking, and wished dressed entirely for themselves. He was still
watching the confection of the dish when the twelve robbers came back.
They gave the two strangers a friendly reception, and invited them to
dinner. This, the old servant had told Rathgeb, was their custom, and
that after dinner they fell upon their guests and slew them at the
moment when they least expected any onslaught.</p>
<p>Rathgeb accepted the invitation, with the proviso that he and his
companion should be allowed to eat their own food, being some game they
had brought down by the way. The robbers made no objection, and they
sat down to table. While waiting for the repast to be brought, the
robbers entertained their guests with lively conversation, in which
Rathgeb joined with great show of cordiality, the young prince
sustaining his part admirably.</p>
<p>When the dishes were brought, the old woman was careful to set the
three ravens before Rathgeb, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href=
"#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>as he had bidden her; but the
chief robber interposed, and said they must really allow him to offer
him and his young friend of their hospitality. Rathgeb made a little
courteous difficulty; and the robber-chief, whose object was not to
thwart his guests in any thing, but make a show of the greatest
civility, said he must really consent to exchange dishes, and not
deprive him of the pleasure of providing in one way or another for his
guests. After holding out for some pressing, Rathgeb consented, and
each set to work to help himself to what was before him, the dish which
had been before the robber-chief having been exchanged with that which
was before Rathgeb.</p>
<p>Rathgeb helped the prince without appearing to take any notice of
what befell the robbers; and Radpot, understanding how important it was
to engender no suspicion, fell with a hunter&rsquo;s appetite upon the
viands without taking his eyes from his plate, after the manner of a
famished man. Before he had devoured many mouthfuls, however, the
poison of the ravens had done its work; one after another, or rather
all together, the robbers fell under the table as suddenly as the
horses and the ravens themselves&mdash;all but one. For one of the
robbers had felt suspicious of the unusual circumstance of guests
bringing their own food with them; when he pointed this out to his
companions, they said it was clear there could be no guile in the
matter, seeing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>the guests had so manifestly prepared it for
their own eating. But he had abstained from incurring the risk himself,
and now alone stood erect amid the dead bodies of his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Draw, prince,&rdquo; said Rathgeb, &ldquo;and rid us of this
scum of the earth! cross not your sword with the defiled one, but smite
him down as a reptile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Radpot did not wait to be twice told; before Rathgeb had done
speaking he had hewn down the swaggering bully, who had thought to make
easy work of an unpractised foe.</p>
<p>Radpot and his counsellor lost no time in continuing their journey.
The store of the robbers they left to the old woman who had befriended
them, and took only a provision of wine and bread with them for their
necessities by the way.</p>
<p>Skirting along the borders of the forest, they shortly came to a
fine city, where they established themselves at the first inn. They sat
down in the <span lang="de">Herrenst&uuml;bchen</span><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3311src" href="#xd21e3311" name=
"xd21e3311src">63</a> while other guests came in. &ldquo;What news is
there?&rdquo; asked Rathgeb of the new comers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;News?&rdquo; asked the person addressed; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
always the <i>old</i> story here&mdash;but that&rsquo;s as strange for
those who don&rsquo;t know it as any news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What may it be, then?&rdquo; pursued Rathgeb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the princess to whom all this country belongs is going
on with her old mad pranks. She is perpetually propounding some new
stupid riddle, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span>promising her hand and kingdom to whomsoever
divines it. But no one <i>can</i> divine the meaning of her nonsense;
and the penalty is, that whoever attempts and fails is dressed like a
fool or jester, with long ears and bells, and is made to ride backwards
all through the city, with all the people hooting and jeering
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rathgeb then informed himself as to the appearance and character of
the princess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, as to that, she is charming in appearance&mdash;radiant
as the sun, dazzling all beholders; that is how so many heads are
turned by her. And as for her mind, there is no fault there either,
except that just because she is more gifted than all other women, she
is thus proud and haughty and unbearable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rathgeb had heard enough, and went out with the prince to make
acquaintance with the city and people, and to talk to him of the plans
which had suggested themselves to him for courting and taming the
princess. Radpot, who had been much pleased with the account of the
princess they heard repeated all around, entered fully into his
projects.</p>
<p>As the princess was much interested in conversing with foreigners,
it was not difficult for Rathgeb and the prince to obtain admission to
her. Rathgeb then proposed the prince to her as suitor; but on the
condition that, instead of the princess proposing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>the
riddle for him to guess, he should propose one for the princess to
guess, and that if she failed, she must marry his prince.</p>
<p>Two motives urged the princess to accede to this arrangement: first,
she felt her credit was staked on not refusing the trial; and then, she
was so struck by the appearance of the handsome young suitor, that she
was very glad to be saved the chance of losing him by his not guessing
her riddle.</p>
<p>Rathgeb&rsquo;s riddle was: &ldquo;What is that of which one killed
two, two killed three, and three killed eleven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princess asked for three days to consider her answer; during
which time she consulted all her clever books and all the wise men of
the kingdom, but she was unable to arrive at any answer which had a
chance of proving to be the right one.</p>
<p>The third day came, and with it Rathgeb and the prince. The princess
was obliged to acknowledge herself vanquished, but found an
over-payment for her vexation in having to marry the handsome prince,
who, however, had, by Rathgeb&rsquo;s advice, not told her that he was
a prince, and they passed for two travelling pedlars.</p>
<p>At first all went well enough. In the happiness of living with a
husband she loved, the Princess forgot many of her haughty ways, and as
the prince governed the kingdom wisely, under Rathgeb&rsquo;s advice,
every body was content. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href=
"#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span></p>
<p>This happy state of things was not destined to last. By degrees the
princess&rsquo;s old habits of self-sufficiency, haughtiness, and bad
temper came back, and Radpot found he had hard lines to keep peace with
her. From day to day this grew worse; and at last he found it hardly
possible to endure her continual reproaches and causeless
vituperation.</p>
<p>In the meantime Rathgeb received the intelligence from the council
of regency that the queen, Radpot&rsquo;s stepmother, was dead, and
that all the people were impatient that he should return and place
himself at the head of the nation.</p>
<p>In communicating this news to the prince, the old counsellor
propounded a scheme for reducing his wife to a better frame of mind
which pleased him well. In accordance with it, Radpot absented himself
from the palace for several days. At the end of that time he returned;
but instead of waiting to listen to the fierce invectives with which
the princess met him on his return, he interrupted her at the beginning
of the discourse by informing her that he had been engaged on important
affairs which did not concern her. Before she had time to recover from
her surprise at his audacity in treating her thus, he went on to say
that this absence was only the prelude to a much longer one, as he was
now called home by his mother, who was a very old woman, and who
entreated him to remain with her during the rest of her days; that he
was about to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>set out, therefore, to go to her, and he could
not say if he should be able ever to come back again&mdash;so he must
bid her adieu.</p>
<p>The princess could not for a long time be induced to believe that he
was serious; but when she really found him making preparations for his
departure, without any allusion to the idea of her accompanying him,
she was so softened and distressed that, but for a sign from Rathgeb,
he would have forgiven her at once, and told her all.</p>
<p>By Rathgeb&rsquo;s advice, he determined to put her change of
demeanour to the test before giving in, and he told her it was
impossible to take her with him.</p>
<p>At this, her pleading to accompany him became still more
earnest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you came with me, you would not have a palace-full of
servants to wait upon you; you would have to live in a poor hut with a
cross old woman, to whom I could not bear that you should answer a
cross word, however peevish she might be; you would have to live on the
poorest fare, and to earn something towards the support of your
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princess, who really loved Radpot devotedly, and was of a good
and noble nature, having erred chiefly through thoughtlessness and want
of self-control, accepted all these hard terms cheerfully, rather than
be separated from her husband.</p>
<p>So they set out the next day. And when they got <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>near
Radpot&rsquo;s capital, Rathgeb went on before to a poor cottage in the
outskirts, where there lived a lone old woman whom he could trust to
carry on his plan by acting as Radpot&rsquo;s mother, without her ever
knowing who he really was.</p>
<p>When Radpot and the princess arrived before this cottage, by
Rathgeb&rsquo;s instruction, the old woman came out and welcomed him as
her son, and Radpot introduced the princess to her as his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much like the wife of an honest workman either!&rdquo;
grumbled the old woman, according to Rathgeb&rsquo;s instructions.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of wife a man picks up when he goes to
foreign parts&mdash;a pert, stuck-up minx! But she&rsquo;ll have to
learn to dress like a sober woman, and make some use of her fingers,
now she&rsquo;s come here, I can tell her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princess could have thrust these words back down the old
woman&rsquo;s throat in an instant, but Radpot imposed silence by a
severe look; and then he reminded her that she had promised submission
and obedience to his mother, adding that, if she desired it, and shrank
from sharing his poverty and hard fare, his friend Rathgeb would even
now take her back to her own country.</p>
<p>But the very idea of parting from him produced immediate submission;
and the old lady happening to be leaning against the table, as if tired
of the exertion of welcoming her son, she even fetched and placed a
chair for her, and helped her gently into it. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span></p>
<p>But still, bad habits cannot be changed all at once, and before the
day was out Radpot had had to put on his severe look to arrest her
angry answer many a time.</p>
<p>The next morning, as soon as they had breakfasted, he said he was
going out for his work as a mason&rsquo;s labourer, and she must choose
what work she would do, as no one must be idle in his house. The
princess timidly replied that she knew many kinds of fine embroidery,
which she thought would sell for a great price, and as she had some
such with her, she would set to work to finish a piece of it, so that
Rathgeb might take it into the town and get it sold.</p>
<p>Radpot came back in the evening, and flung down a few pence on the
table, which he said was the amount of his daily wage, and told her to
go out and get the supper with it. It was little she knew of how to buy
a workman&rsquo;s supper; and what she brought Radpot was so
dissatisfied with that (having dined himself in the palace) he threw it
out of window, so that she had to go supperless to bed. Before she went
up-stairs, however, Radpot told her to show him her day&rsquo;s work;
and when she brought it, expecting him to admire its delicacy and
finish, he at once threw it on one side, saying he was sure such coarse
stuff would not sell there.</p>
<p>The princess spent the night more in weeping than in sleeping. In
the morning she had to get <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href=
"#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>up and prepare the breakfast, in
doing which she not only burnt her hands, but, by her general
awkwardness at the unusual work, incurred a storm of vituperation from
the old mother such as she had often been wont to bestow, while no
rough word had ever been spoken <i>to</i> her before in her whole
life.</p>
<p>All through the day she had to attend to all the old woman&rsquo;s
whims; and in the evening when Radpot came home it was nearly the same
thing again with the supper, and he would scarcely suffer her to snatch
more than a few mouthfuls, so angry he showed himself at her mistakes
in the manner of preparing it. He told her, too, that so long as she
did not know how to earn her food, she must not expect to have much of
it. This made her the more desirous that Rathgeb should take her work
to the town. When he had done so, however, he brought it back, saying
no one would buy such coarse, common work there. Then she tried other
kinds, each finer and more delicate than the last; but all were brought
back to her with the same answer. At last they gave her a basket of
common pottery, and told her to go and sell it to the poor people in
the market-place. This answered rather better than the work. There were
plenty of people who wanted to buy crockery, and the most of them came
to her basket in preference to others&rsquo;, because of her beautiful
face all bathed in tears. But just as she was reckoning up what a nice
sum we should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>now have to take home, and that it would be
acknowledged she had done something right at last, a smartly
caparisoned cavalier came riding past, and, without heed to her cries,
upset the whole of her stock upon the road, smashing every thing to
atoms, and scattering her heap of halfpence into the gutter. She was so
bewildered she hardly thought to look at him, and yet, from the single
glance, he appeared so like Radpot that she almost called to him by
name; he dashed away, however, so quickly, that he was out of hearing
in a minute.</p>
<p>In the evening, when she came to detail her mishap to him, he
appeared to be very angry at her ill success in every thing she
attempted, adding, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll never be any
use to a poor man&mdash;we must get Rathgeb to take you back home
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at this she threw herself at his feet in despair, begged him so
piteously to do any thing but that, promised so earnestly to apply
herself to any mode of life he prescribed for her, provided only he
would keep her by him, that he could hold out no longer, and determined
to put an end to her trial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give you one chance more,&rdquo; he said, trying to
assume a tone of indifference: &ldquo;you shall bring me my dinner
while I am at work to-morrow; that will save me the time of going to
get it, and will be worth something&mdash;only mind, now, don&rsquo;t
make any mistake this time! I am working at the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>palace; bring the dinner there, and ask for the
mason&rsquo;s labourer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day she took good care to have the dinner ready in time;
and though she was filled with confusion at having to go through the
public streets carrying the humble provision of the labourer&rsquo;s
dinner, and every one gazing after her beautiful, tearful face, she yet
went her way bravely, and came at last to the palace.</p>
<p>The moment she asked at the door for the mason&rsquo;s labourer, a
page was sent with her, who conducted her through suites of apartments
vaster and more magnificent than those of her own palace; and, while
she was lost in bewilderment, the page suddenly stopped short and
pointed to a drapery hanging, saying, &ldquo;Pull that aside, and you
will find within, him you seek,&rdquo; and then darted away.</p>
<p>She scarcely dared do as she was bid; but then the clocks began to
strike the midday hour, and, fearful of keeping her husband waiting,
she lifted the drapery with a trembling hand.</p>
<p>On a royal throne, and habited in royal state, there sat Radpot
himself, Rathgeb standing respectfully by his side. The princess
thought to have fainted at the sight, for she could in no way
understand how they came to be there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, princess!&rdquo; said Radpot, encouragingly; and
Rathgeb went to the door, and conducted her up to him. He bid her
welcome, and kissed her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href=
"#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>tenderly, told her frankly what
had been his plans with her, then led her into an adjoining room, where
there were ladies-in-waiting ready to attire her in a robe of
cloth-of-gold and coronet of diamonds, which they held in readiness,
with many choicest ornaments of gold and precious stones. When she was
ready, pages in court suits went before her, and heralds proclaimed her
aloud.</p>
<p>As soon as the prince saw her arrive, he ordered his high council to
be called in, and presented his consort to them, declaring her as
virtuous as she was fair.</p>
<p>After this they lived together many years in great happiness, for
the princess had had a life-long lesson, and never relapsed into her
foolish ways. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">THE THREE BLACK DOGS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The wind roared through the tall fir-trees, and swept
the snow-flakes in masses against the window-panes; the rafters rattled
and the casements clattered; but dismally, above the roaring and the
clattering, sounded the howling of three black dogs at the
cottage-door; for their good master lay on the pallet within, near his
end, and never more should he urge them on to the joyous hunt.</p>
<p>The old man was stark and grey; one bony hand held fast the
bed-clothes with convulsive clutch, and one rested in benediction on
the dark locks of his only son kneeling by his side. Long he lay as if
at the last gasp. Then suddenly raising his weary head from the pillow,
he exclaimed, &ldquo;J&ouml;ssl, my son, forget not to pray for your
father when he is no more.&rdquo; And J&ouml;ssl sobbed in reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;J&ouml;ssl,&rdquo; continued the old man, with painful
effort, &ldquo;you know fortune has never favoured me in this world:
you are my noble boy, and I would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208"
href="#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span>have left you rich enough to
be a great man, as your looks would have you&mdash;but it was not to
be! J&ouml;ssl, it was not to be!&rdquo; and the old man sank back upon
the bed, and hid his face and wept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, you have taught me to labour, to be honest, to face
danger, and to fear God!&rdquo; said the brave youth, throwing himself
upon him and caressing his hollow cheeks; &ldquo;that was the best
inheritance you could leave me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well said! my noble son,&rdquo; replied the father.
&ldquo;But you are young to rough the world by yourself; and I have
nothing to leave you but the Three Black Dogs&mdash;my faithful
dogs&mdash;they are howling my death-knell without. Let them in,
J&ouml;ssl&mdash;they are all you have now in the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>J&ouml;ssl went to let them in; and as he did so the old man&rsquo;s
eyes glazed over and his spirit fled, and J&ouml;ssl returned to find
only a corpse.</p>
<p>The Three Black Dogs ceased their howling when they saw his grief,
and came and fawned upon him and licked his hands. For three days they
remained mourning together; and then the men came and buried the
father. Other people came to live in the cottage, and J&ouml;ssl went
out to wander over the wide world, the Three Black Dogs following
behind.</p>
<p>When there was a day&rsquo;s work to be done they fared well enough.
Though he had so fair a face <span class="corr" id="xd21e3446" title=
"Source: nda">and</span> so noble a bearing, J&ouml;ssl was always
ready to apply his stalwart limbs to labour, and what he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>earned he shared with the Three Black Dogs, who
whined and fawned and seemed to say,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are eating your bread in idleness now; but never mind, the
day will come when we will earn you yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when there was no work to be had, when the storm beat and the
winter wind raged, J&ouml;ssl was fain to share a peasant&rsquo;s meal
where he could find pity by the way, and many there were who said,
&ldquo;God be gracious unto thee, my son,&rdquo; when they saw his
comely face; but the Black Dogs slunk away, as if ashamed that their
master&rsquo;s son should have to beg, not only for himself, but for
them also.</p>
<p>Better times came with the spring; and then there was the
hay-cutting, and the harvesting, and the vintage, and J&ouml;ssl found
plenty of work. But still he journeyed on, and the Three Black Dogs
behind.</p>
<p>At last he saw in the distance the towers of a great city, and he
hasted on, for all his life he had lived in the mountains, and had
never seen a town.</p>
<p>But when he reached it, he found that though it was a vast city, it
was empty and desolate. Broad well-paved roads crossed it, but they
were more deserted than the mountain-tracks. There were workshops, and
smithies, and foundries, and ovens, but all silent and empty, and no
sound was heard! Then he looked up, and saw that every house was draped
with black, and black banners hung from the towers and palaces.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span></p>
<p>Still not a human being appeared, either in the public squares or at
the house-windows; so he still wandered on, and the Three Black Dogs
behind.</p>
<p>At last he espied in the distance a waggoner with his team coming
through the principal road which traversed the city, and lost no time
in making his way up to him and asking what this unearthly stillness
meant.</p>
<p>The waggoner cracked his whip and went on, as if he were frightened
and in a hurry; but J&ouml;ssl kept up with him. So he told him, as
they went along, that for many years past a great Dragon had devastated
the country, eating up all the inhabitants he found in the way, so that
every one shunned the streets; nor should he be going through now, but
that need obliged him to pass that way, and he got through the place as
quickly as he could. But, he added, there was less danger for him now,
because lately they had found that if every morning some one was put in
his way to devour, that served him for the day, and he left off teasing
and worrying others as he had been used to do; so that now a lot was
cast every day, and upon whomsoever of the inhabitants the lot fell, he
had to go out upon the highway early the next morning that the dragon
might devour him and spare the rest.</p>
<p>Just then a crier came into the street, and proclaimed that the lot
that day had fallen on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href=
"#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>king&rsquo;s daughter, and that
to-morrow morning she must be exposed to the dragon.</p>
<p>The people, who had come to the windows to hear what the crier had
to say, now no longer kept within doors. Every one was so shocked to
think that the lot had fallen on their beautiful young princess, that
they all came running out into the streets to bewail her fate aloud;
and the old king himself came into their midst, tearing his clothes and
plucking out his white hair, while the tears ran fast down his
venerable beard.</p>
<p>When J&ouml;ssl saw that, it reminded him of his own father, and he
could not bear to see his tears.</p>
<p>Then the king sent the crier out again to proclaim that if any one
would fight the dragon, and deliver his daughter, he should have her
hand, together with all his kingdom. But the fear of the dragon was so
great on all the people of the city that there was not one would
venture to encounter it, even for the sake of such a prize.</p>
<p>Every hour through the day the crier went out and renewed the
proclamation. But every one was too much afraid of the dragon to make
the venture, and J&ouml;ssl, though he felt he would have courage to
meet the dragon; could not find heart to come forward before all the
people of the king&rsquo;s court, and profess to do what no one else
could do. So the hours went by all through the day <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>and
all through the night, and no one had appeared to deliver the
princess.</p>
<p>Then daybreak came, and with it the mournful procession which was to
conduct the victim to the outskirts of the city; and all the people
came out to see it, weeping. The old king came down the steps of the
palace to deliver up his daughter; and it was all the people could do
to hold him back from giving himself up in her place.</p>
<p>But when the moment of parting from her came, the thought was so
dreadful that he could not bring himself to make the sacrifice; and
when he should have given her up he only clasped her the tighter in his
arms. Then the people began to murmur. They said, &ldquo;The hour is
advancing, and the dragon will be upon us, and make havoc among us all.
When the lot fell upon one of us, we gave up our wives, and our
fathers, and our children; and now the same misfortune has visited you,
you must do no less;&rdquo; and as the time wore on they grew more and
more angry and discontented.</p>
<p>This increased the distress and terror of the king, and he raved
with despair.</p>
<p>When J&ouml;ssl found matters as bad as this, he forgot his
bashfulness, and coming forward through the midst of the crowd, he
asked permission to go out to meet the dragon; &ldquo;and if I
fail,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;at least I shall have prolonged the most
precious <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span>life by one day;&rdquo; and he bent down and
kissed the hem of the princess&rsquo;s garment.</p>
<p>When the princess heard his generous words she took heart, and
looked up, and was right glad to see one of such noble bearing for her
deliverer. But the old king, without stopping to look at him, threw
himself on his neck and kissed him with delight, and called him his
son, and promised him there was nothing of all the crier had proclaimed
that should not be fulfilled.</p>
<p>The discontent of the people was changed into admiration; and they
accompanied J&ouml;ssl to the city gates with shouts of encouragement
as he went forth to meet the dragon, and the Three Black Dogs
behind.</p>
<p>If the king&rsquo;s daughter had been pleased with the appearance of
her deliverer, J&ouml;ssl had every reason to be no less delighted with
that of the lady to whom he was about to devote his life.</p>
<p>Full of hope and enthusiasm, he passed on through the midst of the
people&mdash;regardless of their shouts, for he was thinking only of
her&mdash;and the Three Black Dogs behind.</p>
<p>It was past the time when the dragon usually received his victim,
and he was advancing rapidly towards the city walls, roaring horribly,
and &ldquo;swinging the scaly horrors of his folded tail.&rdquo; The
fury of the monster might have made a more practised arm tremble, but
J&ouml;ssl thought of his father&rsquo;s desire <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>that
he should be a great man, and do brave deeds, and his courage only
seemed to grow as the danger approached. He walked so straight towards
the dragon, with a step so firm and so unlike the trembling gait of his
usual victims, that it almost disconcerted him. When they had
approached each other within a hundred paces, J&ouml;ssl called to his
dog Lightning, &ldquo;At him, good dog!&rdquo; At the first sound of
his voice Lightning sprang to the attack, and with such celerity that
the dragon had no time to decide how to meet his antagonist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fetch him down, Springer!&rdquo; cried J&ouml;ssl next; and
the second dog, following close on Lightning&rsquo;s track, sprang upon
the dragon&rsquo;s neck, and held him to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finish him, Gulper!&rdquo; shouted J&ouml;ssl; and the third
dog, panting for the order, was even with the others in a trice, and
fixing his great fangs in the dragon&rsquo;s flesh, snapped his spine
like glass, and bounded back with delight to his master&rsquo;s
feet.</p>
<p>J&ouml;ssl, only stopping to caress his dogs, drew his knife, and
cut out the dragon&rsquo;s tongue; and then returned to the city with
his trophy, and the Three Black Dogs behind.</p>
<p>If the people had uttered jubilant shouts when he started, how much
more now at his victorious return! The king and his daughter heard the
shout in their palace, and came down to meet the conqueror.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold my daughter!&rdquo; said the old king: &ldquo;take
her; she is yours, and my kingdom with her! I owe all to you, and in
return I give you all I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, sire,&rdquo; interposed J&ouml;ssl; &ldquo;that you give
me permission to approach the princess is all I ask, and that she will
deign to let me think that I may be one day found not unworthy of her
hand. But as regards your kingdom, that is not for me. I am but a poor
lad, and have never had any thing to command but my Three Black Dogs:
how should I, then, order the affairs of a kingdom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king and all the people, and the princess above all, were
pleased with his modesty and grace; and they sounded his praises, and
those of his Three Black Dogs too, and conducted them with him to the
palace, where J&ouml;ssl received a suit of embroidered clothes and the
title of duke, and was seated next the princess.</p>
<p>The king, finding that he was resolute in refusing to accept the
crown, determined to adopt him for his son; and had him instructed in
every thing becoming a prince, so that he might be fit to succeed him
at his death. To the Three Black Dogs were assigned three kennels and
three collars of gold, with three pages to wait on them; and whenever
J&ouml;ssl went on a hunting-party, his Three Black Dogs had precedence
of all the king&rsquo;s dogs.</p>
<p>As time wore on J&ouml;ssl had other opportunities <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>of
distinguishing himself; and by little and little he came to be
acknowledged as the most accomplished courtier and the most valiant
soldier in the kingdom.</p>
<p>The princess had admired his good looks and his self-devotion from
the first, but when she found him so admired and courted by all the
world too, her esteem and her love for him grew every day, till at last
she consented to fulfil the king&rsquo;s wish, and they were married
with great pomp and rejoicing. Never was there a handsomer pair; and
never was there a braver procession of lords and ladies and attendants,
than that which followed them that day, with music and with bells, and
the Three Black Dogs behind.</p>
<p class="xd21e3530">&#8258; There are countless spots in Tirol in
which tales are traditional of brave peasants, hunters, and woodmen
delivering the place out of some need or danger, symbolized as &ldquo;a
dragon,&rdquo; similar in the main to the above, but with varieties of
local colouring. I gave the preference to the above for the sake of the
Three Black Dogs. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217"

<h3 class="main">OTTILIA AND THE DEATH&rsquo;S HEAD;<br>
OR,<br>
&ldquo;PUT YOUR TRUST IN PROVIDENCE.&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the little town of Schwatz, on the Inn, the chief
river of Tirol, there lived once a poor little peasant-girl named
Ottilia. Ottilia had been very fond of her dear mother, and cried
bitterly when she had the great misfortune to lose her. She tried hard
to do all she had seen her mother do: she swept the house and milked
the cow, and baked the bread, and stitched at her father&rsquo;s
clothes; but she could not, with all her diligence, get through it all
as her mother did. The place began to get into disorder, and the pigs
and the fowls fought, and she could not keep them apart, and she could
not manage the spinning; and what was worst of all, she could not carry
in the loads of hay, by which her mother had earned the few pence that
eked out her father&rsquo;s scanty wages. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb218" href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span></p>
<p>To keep the house straight, the good man found himself obliged to
take another wife; and one day he brought home the tall Sennal, and
told Ottilia she was to be her mother.</p>
<p>When poor little Ottilia heard the tall, hard, bony woman called
&ldquo;her mother,&rdquo; she burst out into passionate tears, and
declared she should never be her mother, and she would never pay her
obedience!</p>
<p>Now the tall Sennal was not a bad woman, but she was angry when the
child set herself against her; and so there was continual anger between
the two. When she told Ottilia to do any thing, Ottilia refused to do
it, lest she should be thought to be thereby regarding her as her
mother, which seemed to her a kind of sacrilege; and when she tried to
do any of the work of the house, her childish inexperience made her do
it in a way that did not suit the tall Sennal&rsquo;s thrift, so there
was nothing but strife in the house. Yet the good father contrived,
when he came home of an evening, to set things straight, and make
peace; and though Ottilia had little pleasure, like other children of
her years, yet she had a good woollen frock to keep out the cold, and
bread and cheese and milk enough to drive away hunger, and, what she
valued most, a father&rsquo;s knee to sit on of an evening in the
well-warmed room, while he kissed her and told her weird stories of the
days long gone by. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219"
name="pb219">219</a>]</span></p>
<p>But a day came&mdash;a day darkened by a terrible storm&mdash;on
whose evening no father came home. The long Sennal went out with the
neighbours with lanterns and horns, but the fierce winds extinguished
their lights and drowned the sound of their horns; and Ottilia knelt by
the side of her father&rsquo;s chair, praying and crying.</p>
<p>She prayed and wept, and only slept a little now and then, all
through the night; and in the morning some carters came in, and brought
her father&rsquo;s dead body, which they had found on their mountain
way, under the snow, where it lay buried.</p>
<p>But Ottilia still knelt by her father&rsquo;s chair, and felt like
one in a dream, while they put him in his coffin and carried him to the
churchyard ground, and the sad bells mourned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, child, and feed the pig!&rdquo; exclaimed the harsh voice
of the tall Sennal&mdash;and it sounded harsher than ever now, for
there was none left to apply the curb. &ldquo;Crying&rsquo;s all very
well for a bit; but you&rsquo;re not going on like that all your life,
I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ottilia felt her helplessness, and therefore resented the
admonition. Without stopping to consider its reasonableness, she
retorted, fiercely,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Child!&rsquo; I am no child of yours! I&rsquo;ve told
you so before, a thousand times; and it&rsquo;s not because my
father&rsquo;s dead that you&rsquo;re going to come over me. You think
you&rsquo;ll make me forget him by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220"
href="#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>forbidding me to cry for him;
but never, never will I forget him! nor shall you forget how he made
you behave properly to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tall Sennal had more patience with her than might have been
expected, and said no more for that time; but Ottilia was not won by
her forbearance, and only reckoned it as a victory.</p>
<p>It was strife again the next day, and the next, and there was no
good father to make peace. And at last the tall Sennal&rsquo;s patience
fairly gave way, and one day, in her provocation, she drove the child
from the door, and bid her never come under her eyes again!</p>
<p>Her anger cooled, she could have recalled the words, but Ottilia was
already far away up the mountain-path, and out of sight, gone she knew
not whither.</p>
<p>Ottilia had no experience of want, and knew not what it was to be
alone upon the mountains; all her full heart felt at the moment was,
that it would be a boon to get away from the reproaches her conscience
told her were not undeserved, and be alone with her parent&rsquo;s
memory.</p>
<p>Thus she wandered on, with no more consciousness of her way than
just to follow it to the spot where her father died, and which had been
marked by pious custom with a wayside cross, on which was painted in
vivid strokes the manner of his end.</p>
<p>Ottilia gazed at the cruel scene till fresh tears <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span>started to her eyes, and she threw herself on
the ground beside it, and cried till she knew no more where she was.
Then it seemed to her as if the ground were again covered with snow,
and that from under it she heard her father&rsquo;s voice; and he
talked to her as he used to talk of an evening by the fireside, when
she was on his knee after work and he made her peace with the tall
Sennal. And now he brought home to her all her naughty, senseless ways,
not scolding without reason, but making all allowance for the filial
love which had been at the bottom of the strife. Ottilia seemed to
herself to be listening to him with great attention, but her heart
misgave her. She was ready to own now that she had been very wrong,
very unreasonable, and she felt really sorry for it all&mdash;so sorry
that, had her home still been his, she felt that she could have brought
herself to obey Sennal, so that she might not grieve him; but
now&mdash;now that he was not there&mdash;suppose he should require of
her that she should go back now and live with the tall Sennal, all
alone! But he did not require it of her; or, at all events, in her
excitement she woke with his last words sounding in her ear, which were
nothing more severe than, &ldquo;Put your trust in God, and all will
yet be well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun had already sunk behind the mountains, the chill night air
began to penetrate Ottilia&rsquo;s clothing, and hunger stared her in
the face. She <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>felt very humble now, but she had no mind to go
back. She rose and walked on, for numbness, as of death, was creeping
over her, and she knew the mountain-folk said that to yield to that
lethargy of cold was death.</p>
<p>On she walked, and on, and the darkness gathered thicker and thicker
round her; but she thought of her guardian angel, and she was not
afraid. Still the way was weary, and the air was keen, and her strength
began to fail. Then suddenly, on a neighbouring peak, she descried the
broken outline of a castellated building standing out against the now
moonlit sky.</p>
<p>Gathering fresh force from hope, she picked her way over steep and
stone, guiding her steps by the friendly light which beamed from a
turret window. She had had time to realize her whole desolation. If
heaven vouchsafed her another chance of finding a home, she mentally
resolved, she would behave so as to win its blessing, with all her
might.</p>
<p>When at last she reached the castle-gate her courage once more began
to fail&mdash;what would the great people at the castle say to a poor
little half-starved peasant-girl, who came without friend or warrant to
disturb their rest? &ldquo;Where is your trust in Providence?&rdquo;
said a voice within, which sounded like a memory of her father&rsquo;s,
and rekindled her courage.</p>
<p>A horn hung beside the broad portal; and when, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>after many timorous efforts, Ottilia had
succeeded in making a note resound, she stood anxiously wondering what
stern warder or fierce man-at-arms would answer the summons.</p>
<p>None such appeared, however. But after some moments of anxious
waiting, the window whence the friendly light beamed was opened, with
noise enough to make her look up, and then&mdash;what do you think she
saw?</p>
<p>Nothing but a <i>Death&rsquo;s Head</i> looking out of the window!
Almost before she had time to be frightened, it asked her, in a very
kindly voice, what was her pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A night&rsquo;s lodging and a bit of bread, for the love of
Christ!&rdquo; said Ottilia, faintly; and then she looked up again at
the Death&rsquo;s Head, and she could not resist a sense of horror and
faintness that crept over her. &ldquo;Put your trust in God,&rdquo;
whispered her father&rsquo;s voice, and she made an effort to stay her
teeth from chattering together.</p>
<p>Meantime, the Death&rsquo;s Head had answered cheerily enough,
&ldquo;Will you promise to carry me up here again faithfully, if I come
down and draw the bolt for you, and let you in?&rdquo; and scarcely
knowing what she said, Ottilia gave an assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think what you are saying, and swear that I can rely on
you,&rdquo; persisted the Death&rsquo;s Head, &ldquo;for, you see, it
is a serious matter for me. I can easily roll down the steps, but there
are a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>good many of them, and I can&rsquo;t get up
again by myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you may rely on me,&rdquo; now answered Ottilia,
for she saw it was but her bounden duty to perform this return of
kindness&mdash;and conscience seemed to have a reproach for her
courageous alacrity, saying, &ldquo;The tall Sennal never required of
you any thing so hard as this.&rdquo; &ldquo;I know she
didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Ottilia, humbly; &ldquo;and this is my
punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this time the Death&rsquo;s Head was coming rumbling down the
stone stairs&mdash;and a hard, dismal sound it was. Clop, clop, clop,
first round the turret spiral; then r-r-r-r-r-roll along the long
echoing corridor; and then, clop, clop, clop once more all down the
broad main staircase; then another r-r-r-r-r-roll; and finally, klump!
bump! it came against the massive door.</p>
<p>Ottilia felt her heart go clop, clop, clop, clop, too, but she
struggled hard; and the cold, and the faintness of hunger made her yet
feel rejoiced to hear the Death&rsquo;s Head take the bolt between its
grinning teeth and draw it sharply back. The great door flew open, and
Ottilia trod timidly within the welcome shelter. The memory of her
father&rsquo;s fate was fresh upon her, and the Death&rsquo;s Head was
less terrible than the pitiless snow.</p>
<p>Not without some difficult mental struggles Ottilia faithfully
fulfilled her promise. A temptation, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb225" href="#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span>indeed, came to let
the skull lie. It could not pursue her&mdash;it could not possibly
climb up all those stairs, though it could roll down them; besides, it
had declared its incapacity for the task. She could let it lie and
enter into possession of the castle&mdash;it was clear there was no one
else there, or the skull would not have put itself in danger by coming
to the door. But honest little Ottilia repelled the thought with
indignation, and, bending down, she picked up the skull, and carried it
carefully up the stairs folded in her apron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lay me on the table,&rdquo; said the Death&rsquo;s Head, when
they got into the turret-chamber where the light was; &ldquo;and then
go down into the kitchen and make a pancake. It won&rsquo;t be for want
of eggs and flour and butter if it is not good, for they are there in
plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! go all the way down to the kitchen alone, in this great
strange place?&rdquo; said poor little trembling Ottilia to herself.
&ldquo;This is worse than any thing the tall Sennal ever gave me to do
indeed;&rdquo; but she felt it was a punishment and a trial of her
resolution, and she started to obey with brave determination.</p>
<p>It was a harder task even than she had imagined, for if the
Death&rsquo;s Head was safe up-stairs in the turret tower, the
&ldquo;cross-bones&rdquo; were at large in the kitchen, and
<i>would</i> get in her way whatever she turned to do. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span></p>
<p>True, her impulse for a moment was to turn and scream, and run away,
but there came her father&rsquo;s voice, bidding her trust in God,
&ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;what is there so
very dreadful about the sight of dead bones, after all? and what harm
can they do me?&rdquo; So she took no notice of what was going on
around her, but beat her eggs and mixed her batter, and put it on to
fry, till the appetizing odour and the warmth of the fire brought back
life and renewed her courage.</p>
<p>When Ottilia brought the pancake up into the turret-room, and laid
the dish with it on the table, she observed that the side of the
pancake which was turned towards the skull became black, while that
nearest herself retained its own golden colour; so that her curiosity
was piqued, and she was much inclined to ask about it, but she managed
to keep quiet and eat her share in silence. When she had finished she
took the dish and washed it up, and put all away carefully; and she was
just feeling very tired when the Death&rsquo;s Head said to her,
&ldquo;If you go up that staircase on the left, you will come to a
little bedroom where you may sleep. About midnight a skeleton will come
to your bedside, and try to pull you out of bed; all you have to do is
not to be afraid of it, and then it can do you no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Ottilia thanked the skull, and went up to bed. She had not been
in bed more than three hours when she heard a great noise and rattling
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>the room, much like the noise the cross-bones
had made in the kitchen while she was cooking the pancake. Then she
heard the skull call up to her, &ldquo;It is just
midnight&mdash;remember you have only to be brave!&rdquo; And as it
spoke she saw a great skeleton come and stand in the bright moonbeam by
her bedside! It stretched one of its long bare arms out towards her,
and pulled off the bed-clothes with one bony hand and seized her by the
hair with the other. But Ottilia listened for her father&rsquo;s voice
bidding her put her trust in Providence; and she remained quite quiet
in her bed, giving no sign of fear. When the skeleton found that she
was so brave, it could do nothing against her, but, after two or three
ineffectual tugs, turned and went away; and she saw nothing more of it,
but slept out the rest of the night in peace.</p>
<p>When she woke the next morning the bright sun was pouring cheerfully
into the room, and by the bedside, where the skeleton had stood the
night before, was a beautiful form of a woman, all clothed in white and
surrounded by golden rays, to whom Ottilia said, &ldquo;What do you
want me to do, bright lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the vision answered, &ldquo;I was the mistress of this castle,
who, for my pride and vanity, was condemned to dwell in my bare bones
on the same spot where I had sinned by my extravagance in dress, and
other wanton habits, until one should come, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>for
the sake of whose thrifty, humble ways, and steadfast trust in God, I
should be set free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This you have accomplished, and now I can go to my rest;
while, in gratitude, I endow you with this castle and all its lands and
revenues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the bright form disappeared; and a moment afterwards
Ottilia saw, through the window, a milk-white dove winging its upward
flight towards heaven.</p>
<p>So Ottilia became a rich countess, and mistress of the lordly castle
which she had entered as a suppliant. But no sooner was she installed
than she sent for the long Sennal; and, having besought her pardon for
all the trouble she had given her, begged her to come up to the castle
and be with her. So they lived very happily together for the rest of
their lives. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">THE TWO CASKETS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was a summer holiday; the sun shone with burning
rays on the newly-mown banks; the roads and paths seemed knee-deep with
dust; the flowers by the wayside hung their heads, as if praying for
the refreshing shower; the very waters of the streamlet were heated as
they passed along, and Franzl, lying indolently on its bank, plunged
his hands beneath its bright surface, but found no cooling. With a
peevish exclamation, he rose and sauntered away, and wished there were
no holidays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, don&rsquo;t wish that!&rdquo; said a gentle fair-haired
maiden by his side; &ldquo;and just on this one, too, which I have been
longing for, to fill the basket I made for mother with fresh
strawberries from the wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bad idea of yours, Walburga; they all call you the
&lsquo;wise&rsquo; Walburga,&rdquo; replied Franzl.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s shade in the wood, and the strawberries will be
cooler and more refreshing than this nasty stream.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span></p>
<p>And with that he strolled away towards the wood.</p>
<p>The cottage of Franzl and Walburga was nestled into the side of a
steep hill, the summit of which was mantled with a forest of lofty
pines; and up the precipitous path, which wound past the very chimneys
of the cottage, Franzl now strolled alone, without troubling himself to
offer his hand to the patient little maiden who toiled painfully behind
him, with many a slip upon the loose stones and sunburnt moss.</p>
<p>This was Franzl&rsquo;s character. He was always thus: his own
amusement, his own enjoyment, and his own ease, were his sole care. Nor
had the example of Walburga&rsquo;s loving thoughtfulness for others
any effect upon him. If he took any notice of her at all, it was only
to laugh and rail at her for it, till her silence shamed his
reproaches.</p>
<p>At the pinnacle of the path there was a venerable stone cross,
shaded from the weather by a little pent-house covered with ivy.
Walburga knelt before it as she passed, and prayed for help to be
always a good, obedient child, and a blessing to her dear parents.
Franzl raised his hand to his cap mechanically, because it was the
custom, but no holy thought crossed his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last there is some coolness after all this horrid heat!
and now we are close to those nice refreshing strawberries.&rdquo;
These were his only ideas. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href=
"#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span></p>
<p>To Walburga, as she knelt, there came sweet lessons she had been
taught to associate with the cross&mdash;of abnegation of self,
obedience to higher powers, and loving devotion to others.</p>
<p>Franzl looked with all his eager eyes to discern the bright red
berries where the shade lay diapered with the light darting between the
thick clothing of the pine-trees, without so much as casting a glance
at the sacred token.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a splendid haul!&rdquo; he cried, and plunged
through the thick leafage to where the ripe, rich berries clustered
closest, and, without troubling himself to learn whether Walburga was
as well supplied, began helping himself to his heart&rsquo;s
content.</p>
<p>Walburga lined her basket with fresh green leaves, and laid the
strawberries in tasteful order upon them, only now and then taking the
smallest and most worthless for herself.</p>
<p>Though possessed with different objects, both were equally eager in
the pursuit, and they pushed deeper and deeper into the thick pine
forest, Walburga always keeping near Franzl, by reason of her tender,
confiding spirit, which loved to be near those dear to her, though he,
intent on his own gratification, had no cheerful word to enliven
her.</p>
<p>At last they came to where the dark pines closed thick
overhead&mdash;so thick that no golden rays pierced through; all was
shade and silence. But here the strawberries were no longer ripe and
red, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>for there was no sun to bring them to maturity,
so Franzl peevishly turned to go, and Walburga followed gently behind.
Suddenly their progress was arrested by a bright light&mdash;brighter
than the burning summer sun shining beneath the gloom of the dark
pines&mdash;and in the centre of that light stood a beautiful queen,
and the light seemed to come from the diadem on her forehead and the
garments that encompassed her!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; she said, in soft sweet
accents, addressing herself to Walburga.</p>
<p>And Walburga, dropping her eyelids with maiden modesty, replied,
hardly able to force her voice above a whisper, &ldquo;Gathering
strawberries for mother dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beautiful Lady smiled a smile of approval; and the bright light
seemed brighter when she smiled, and a sweet and balmy breeze stirred
the air when she spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, my child,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;take this
casket;&rdquo; and she handed her a casket made just like the
strawberry-basket she had woven for her mother, only it was all of pure
gold filigree, and, in place of the piled-up strawberries, it had a lid
of sparkling carbuncles. &ldquo;Take this, my child; and when you open
it think of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are <i>you</i> doing?&rdquo; she said, with
something less of mildness, to Franzl, who, having his hat full of
strawberries, was so busy devouring them <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb233" href="#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span>that he had not even
noticed the beautiful present his sister had received.</p>
<p>Nor did he stop now even to reply to her; but between throwing away
one chuck and picking out another fruit, he muttered,
rudely,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you might see that, without asking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beautiful Lady looked at him sadly, and tears like pearls fell
fast down her fair cheeks, as she gave him a dark iron casket, with the
same words she had used to Walburga.</p>
<p>The light disappeared, and the fair Lady was seen no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can that bright Lady be? and what can these caskets be
that she has given us?&rdquo; said Walburga, timidly. &ldquo;Let us
come home quick, and show them to mother;&rdquo; and she ran onwards
gaily, calling out, &ldquo;Mother, mother dear, see what I have
got!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuff!&rdquo; replied Franzl; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to
wait for that: I want to see what&rsquo;s in them now.&rdquo; But
Walburga had passed on out of hearing.</p>
<p>He pulled the lid off his dark iron casket; and immediately there
wriggled out two great black ugly snakes, which grew bigger and longer,
dancing round him; nor could he escape from their meshes. Then,
finally, they closed their coils tightly round him, and carried him
away through the thick, sunless forest, and no one ever saw him
again!</p>
<p>Meantime Walburga was making her way home <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span>with
all the speed she could down the dangerous mountain track, her
strawberry-basket in one hand and the golden casket in the other. Her
mother sat spinning in the luxuriant shade of the climbing plants
over-shadowing the broad cottage-eaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, dear mother!&rdquo; cried the child; &ldquo;see what
I have got. Here is a basket of fresh cool strawberries I have gathered
for you in the wood, and here is a golden casket which a beautiful Lady
brought me, with a great shining light! But stop till Franzl comes
home, for he is coming behind, and she gave him a dark iron casket too,
and we will open them both together; so eat the strawberries, mother
dear, till Franzl comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother kissed her child fondly, and stroked her fair, soft,
curling hair, but turned her head and wept, for she knew what had
befallen.</p>
<p>But Franzl came not; and when Walburga had sought him every where,
she said, &ldquo;He must be gone round by the woodman&rsquo;s track to
meet father, so let us open the casket, mother dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she put the casket in her mother&rsquo;s lap, and lifted the
beautiful carbuncle lid. And see! there flew thereout two tiny beings,
all radiant with rainbow light, and they grew bigger and bigger,
fluttering round her till they appeared two holy angels, who folded the
child softly in their arms, then spread their wings and flew away with
her, singing enchanting melodies, above the clouds! <span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">THE PRUDENT COUNSELLOR.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Alois Zoschg was a peasant of the Sarnthal; his
holding was inconsiderable, but it sufficed for all his needs; his
cottage was small, but his family consisted of only himself and his
daughter, and they found room for all their requirements.</p>
<p>Katharina was bright enough, however, to make any home happy. Though
she shared the cottage with her father alone, she never seemed to feel
the want of younger companions; thoughtful and prudent beyond her
years, and thrifty and notable with all the work of the place, she was
at the same time always ready with her joke and her song. It was no
wonder that her father doated on her, and looked forward all through
the day&rsquo;s toil to the evening spent in cheerful conversation with
her.</p>
<p>There were thus the elements of a pleasant existence in Alois&rsquo;
lot, but there were two disturbing causes also. One was his own temper,
which was violent and ungovernable at times, when he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>was
seriously provoked. The other was the jealousy and animosity of a rich
peasant neighbour, Andr&auml; Margesin, the owner of a considerable
Hof<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3741src" href="#xd21e3741" name=
"xd21e3741src">64</a> situated at no great distance from Zoschg&rsquo;s
cottage, <i lang="de">auf der Putzen</i>.</p>
<p>Circumstances had constantly brought the two neighbours into
collision; the fault generally lay, in the first instance, on the side
of the rich Andr&auml; Margesin, who was grasping and overbearing, but
Alois Zoschg once roused, would never let a quarrel rest, and his
irritability and revengeful spirit were oftentimes enough to disturb
the peace of the whole neighbourhood. No one could say where such
quarrels might have ended, what crimes might perhaps have been the
result, but for the wise interposition of Katharina, who knew how to
soothe her father&rsquo;s ruffled spirit without ever exceeding the
limits of filial respect, as well as how to conciliate the rich
neighbour, without condescending to the use of any servile arts.</p>
<p>By her extraordinary good sense and good temper alone, she would,
time after time, bring both the men back to sober reason from the
highest reach of fury.</p>
<p>Once, however, they had a dispute which was beyond her competence to
decide for them, for it involved a question of law. Andr&auml; Margesin
accused Alois Zoschg of an encroachment, while Alois <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237</a>]</span>Zoschg maintained he was justified in what he
had done, by prescriptive right. The dispute raged high, but all
Katharina could do in this case to restore peace, was to exact a
promise from both parties that they would cease from all mutual
recrimination, and carry the matter to be decided for them by the judge
in Botzen.</p>
<p>When the day of hearing came on, the two disputants went up to
Botzen to plead their cause; but each was so determined not to give
way, and had so much to say in defence of his own position, and to the
disparagement of his antagonist, that they carried their pleadings on
for six days, and yet there seemed no chance of arriving at a decision
which should be thoroughly justified by the evidence, so contradictory
was it. At last, the judge, getting tired of the prolonged controversy,
and finding it impossible to moderate the virulence of the combatants,
told them that he could have no more wrangling, they had so confused
the case with their statements and counter-statements, that it was
impossible to say which of them was right, or, rather, which of them
was least in the wrong; but he gave them one chance of obtaining a
decision of the matter, and that was by accepting a test, which he
would propound, of their ability and judgment, and whichever succeeded
in that, he should pronounce was the one who was in the right in the
original pleading. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238"
name="pb238">238</a>]</span></p>
<p>The rivals looked somewhat disconcerted at this mode of procedure,
but, as they found they could not get the affair decided on any other
terms, they at last agreed to accept the proposal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must tell me, then,&rdquo; said the judge, &ldquo;by
to-morrow morning at this hour, what is that which is the Strongest,
the Richest, and the most Beautiful;&rdquo; with these words he left
the judgment-seat, and the two peasants were left standing opposite
each other, looking very foolish, for they both thought that it would
be impossible ever to answer such a question.</p>
<p>After a few moments&rsquo; consideration, however, Andr&auml;
Margesin, who was a very vain man, bethought himself of an answer
which, to his mind, seemed indisputably the right one. &ldquo;To be
sure! Of course! I wonder I didn&rsquo;t see it at once! There can be
no doubt about it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, aloud; and clapping his hands,
and making other triumphant gesticulations, he stalked off homewards,
telling all his friends that he had no doubt of the result.</p>
<p>But poor Alois Zoschg, the more he thought, the more puzzled he got,
and the boasts of Andr&auml; Margesin only made him more furious. There
he stood, crying out against the judge, and against his ill-luck,
against his poverty and the opulence of Margesin, till it became
necessary to close the court, and his friends prevailed on him to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>go home. But all the way his passion grew more
and more outrageous, and by the time he reached his cottage he was
raging like a maniac; the other men could do nothing with him, and
slunk away one by one, some in disgust, some in despair.</p>
<p>It was now Katharina&rsquo;s turn; and Katharina came out to meet
him with her brightest smile and her filial greeting, just as if he had
been in the best humour in the world.</p>
<p>But, for the first time, the sight of Katharina seemed rather to
increase than allay his anger; for he found her dressed in all her
festal attire&mdash;a proceeding which was quite out of character with
his present disposition.</p>
<p>There was he, worn out with the long dispute, the weariness of the
delayed decision, the provocation of his enemy&rsquo;s insulting mien,
and still more, perhaps, by his own ill-humour; and there she stood,
all smiles and bright colours, as for a joyful occasion&mdash;the white
<i>Stotzhaube</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3777src" href="#xd21e3777"
name="xd21e3777src">65</a> coquettishly set on her braided hair, the
scarlet bodice tightly embracing her comely shape, with
&ldquo;follow-my-lads<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3780src" href=
"#xd21e3780" name="xd21e3780src">66</a>&rdquo; streamers from her
shoulder-knot, the bright red stockings showing under her short black
skirt, and the blue apron over it, in place of the white apron of
working days! Could any thing be more incongruous? <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>was
it not enough to increase his madness?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Katharina&rsquo;s judgment so uniformly approved
itself to his better reason, that, the first impulse passed, he gulped
down the rising exclamation of annoyance until he had heard what
Katharina had to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, father, so you&rsquo;re all right! and I&rsquo;m the
first to congratulate you,&rdquo; she cried, and flung her arms round
him with an embrace, of which, even in his present state of excitement,
he could hardly resist the tenderness and effusion, and as if she did
not perceive the traces of his ill-humour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Right,&rsquo; wench! what mean you? all <i>wrong</i>
you <i>should</i> say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I mean it is all right; and it only remains for you
to hear it pronounced by the judge to-morrow&mdash;and haven&rsquo;t I
put on my gala suit to celebrate your success?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Success! speak! what mean you?&rdquo; cried Alois, eagerly,
his stormy vexation melting away before the sunbeam of her
encouragement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what has the judge told you to do, to decide the
case?&rdquo; asked Katharina, who had heard it all from a neighbour who
came home hours before, while Alois was still standing perplexed in the
court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I should tell him by to-morrow morning,&rdquo; replied
Alois, softened already by her consoling <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb241" href="#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span>manner, &ldquo;what
it is which is the strongest, the richest, and the most
beautiful&mdash;and how am I ever to guess all <i>that</i>? And
what&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; he continued, relapsing into his former state
of vexation, &ldquo;that fellow Andr&auml; Margesin has guessed
it&mdash;guessed it already! and is gone off proclaiming his
triumph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, father!&rdquo; exclaimed Katharina, with a mocking laugh,
all of fun, however, not of scorn; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t mean to say
you believe that great bully Andr&auml; Margesin could have guessed the
right answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he <i>said</i> so! he went off telling every one
so,&rdquo; rejoined Alois, positively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you dear, good, simple father! do you really believe it
is so because he boasts of it? Do rest easy; <i>he&rsquo;s</i> not got
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but if he hasn&rsquo;t, I haven&rsquo;t either. How am
I to guess such captious absurdities? Why couldn&rsquo;t the man judge
the thing on its merits, instead of tormenting one to this
extent?&rdquo; and Alois was getting cross again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it is the best chance in the world, you couldn&rsquo;t
have been more favoured! As to Andr&auml;, he&rsquo;ll never guess it.
Now just think what answer you&rsquo;ll give.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>I</i> should never guess any, if I thought till
doomsday! But you&rdquo;&mdash;and he started with the clever
thought&mdash;&ldquo;<i>you</i>, of course, who always find a way out
of every thing&mdash;what do <i>you</i> say?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; answered Katharina, readily, &ldquo;what is
Stronger than the earth on which we stand, which bears up our houses
and buildings, our rocks and mighty mountains, which all our united
efforts could not suffice to move one inch from its place, and on which
we all rest secure, confident that none is strong enough to displace
it? What more Beauteous than spring, with its fresh, soft tints on sky
and mountain, on alp<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3841src" href=
"#xd21e3841" name="xd21e3841src">67</a> and mead, on blossom and
flower&mdash;spring, with its promise and its hope? And what Richer
than autumn, with its gifts which make us glad for all the
year&mdash;its bursting ears of grain, its clustered grapes, its
abundant olives and luscious fruits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katharina, girl, I believe you&rsquo;ve found it!&rdquo; said
her father, with enthusiasm. &ldquo;My bonny girl has saved me this
time also!&rdquo; and he clasped her in his arms. Though misgivings
would come back when he recalled Andr&auml;&rsquo;s assurance, he yet
went to bed happy in the consciousness of at least having a good chance
of not being beaten.</p>
<p>In the morning he was up betimes, and, having taken great pains to
learn what he had to say from Katharina, who walked a good stretch of
the way through the valley with him, he arrived at the court in
tolerably good humour.</p>
<p>Andr&auml; was there before him, and in high good <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=
"pb243">243</a>]</span>humour too; taking for granted that, as the
richer and more important man, and, moreover, as the victor (so he felt
assured), he had the right to speak first. As soon as the judge had
taken his seat, and even before he had called on him for his answer, he
began,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir judge, I have the answer to your enigma; and as soon as I
have told it, you will please give judgment in my favour. It was indeed
easy enough to find, so I claim no merit in the discovery,&rdquo; he
added, with the pride that apes humility. &ldquo;The most Beautiful
thing on earth is my wife, of course; the Strongest, are my oxen; and
the Richest, am I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judge listened without moving a muscle of his countenance, as
became a judge, and for those who were too obtuse to perceive the fine
irony of the smile with which he bowed to the speaker at the conclusion
of his harangue&mdash;and among these was certainly Andr&auml;
himself&mdash;it seemed as if he was quite satisfied with the answer.
Nevertheless, he turned to Alois, and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my man, and what is <i>your</i> answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the judgment, good sir judge! would your honour be
pleased to pronounce the sentence in my favour, seeing I have given
your worship the answer?&rdquo; interposed Andr&auml; Margesin,
fussily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gently and fairly!&rdquo; replied the judge; &ldquo;wait only
a little: we must hear what friend Alois has <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>to
say. He <i>might</i> have an answer, you know; and, anyhow, we must
give him the opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andr&auml; chafed, but could not resist; and, at an encouraging word
from the judge, Alois stood forward and repeated word for word the
answer Katharina had taught him.</p>
<p>Though the judge had preserved his imperturbability through the
expression of Andr&auml;&rsquo;s silly bombast, this answer of Alois
was too much for his composure. He had only proposed the enigma as the
means of getting rid of a perplexing case. He had no idea but that both
peasants would bring an answer of which he could easily expose the
folly; and thus, neither having fulfilled the prescribed terms, the
case would fall through of itself, and he be saved from further
trouble. But he saw nothing to reply to Alois&rsquo; solution of his
question, nor any means of escaping from giving judgment in his favour.
Every body acquiesced in the justice of the decision; and even
Andr&auml; himself had nothing to say, but, crestfallen, and in very
different style from his confidence of the day before, he made his exit
while people were yet engaged with the discussion of Alois&rsquo;
success, so as to avoid alike scorn and condolence.</p>
<p>The session over, the judge called Alois aside, and inquired how he
had come to find so accurate an answer; upon which Alois, who burnt to
proclaim the merit of his child, at once referred the honour to
Katharina. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;That is it, is it?&rdquo; replied the judge. &ldquo;I have
often seen the girl at church, and am not surprised that so comely a
form is inhabited by so clever a mind. Now, go home, and tell your
daughter that if she finds out the way to come to me without any
clothes on, and yet not naked; not by day, and yet not by night; and by
a way which shall be neither a high-road nor yet a by-path, I shall
take the opportunity of her so coming to ask her to be my
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alois lost no time in returning home to tell the good news to his
daughter. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll find one of your clever ways of
doing it, though, for myself, I confess I don&rsquo;t understand a word
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you really mean that that good, noble, handsome judge
really means to make his wife of a poor peasant girl like
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might do worse,&rdquo; answered her father, with archness
and pride. &ldquo;But there is no doubt he was in earnest. You should
have seen the fire in his eye when he spoke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, you may depend I will find the way to fulfil
his directions: trust me for that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor was she long in finding a way which satisfied the judge
completely. She took off all her clothes, and then covered herself with
fishing-nets; this for the first condition. Then, for the second, she
timed her journey in the dusk of evening, which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span>is
neither called day nor night; and, for the third, she had previously
had the road covered with boards, and upon these she walked, so that
she neither trod the high-road nor yet a by-path.</p>
<p>Delighted at acquiring such a prize, and having so clever a maiden
for his future companion through life, the judge married Katharina
before the end of the month. There were great rejoicings at the
wedding, to which all the country-side was invited; and then the poor
peasant girl was installed in the judge&rsquo;s house. The judge,
however, had exacted of her one condition, which was that she should
never interfere with any of her clever suggestions in any case brought
before him for decision, but let justice take its free and
uninterrupted course.</p>
<p>Years passed by happily enough. The judge rejoiced more and more
every day over the wisdom of his choice, and Katharina sedulously
observed the condition imposed upon her, and never interfered with her
husband&rsquo;s dealings in the court.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it happened one day that a peasant whom she had known
from her infancy had a case before the judge which was nearly as
perplexed as that of her father had been, and, despairing of making his
right apparent, the peasant came to Katharina, and begged her, by their
lifelong friendship, to give him one of those good counsels for which
she had been so famous at home in the days gone by. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span></p>
<p>Katharina urged her promise to her husband, and for a long time
refused to break it; but the wily peasant contrived to work on her
vanity so effectually, that at last, in an evil moment, she consented
this once to give her advice, exacting first a promise he would never
tell any one she had done so.</p>
<p>The case was this. Her friend&rsquo;s <i>Senner</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3908src" href="#xd21e3908" name=
"xd21e3908src">68</a> had been visited in the night by a <i>Saligen
Fraulein</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3913src" href="#xd21e3913"
name="xd21e3913src">69</a>, who had promised to milk his cow for him,
and every one knew that when a <i>Saligen Fraulein</i> milked a cow, it
gave three times as much milk as the wont. But being a poor man, and
having only one cow, he eked out his living by taking in cows to graze
on his allotment; and he also only had one milking-pail. The <i>Saligen
Fraulein</i>, therefore, when she had milked his pail full, had been
obliged to take a pail belonging to the man to whom the other cows
belonged, who was a rich man, and had a store of all sorts of utensils.
But the milk being in one of his pails, his <i>Senner</i> swore that it
had been milked from one of his cows, and refused to give it up, though
he had no right to it whatever; and he had declined payment for the use
of the pail.</p>
<p>Though the case had been argued since the first thing that morning,
they were no nearer arriving at a decision. Now the disputants had been
ordered to stand back while another case was called, but it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>would come on again immediately; and in the
meantime the poor peasant entreated Katharina&rsquo;s counsel as his
only chance of rescuing his milk before it turned sour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see one means, I think, of bringing him to his
senses,&rdquo; said Katharina, after she had yielded to her poor
friend&rsquo;s importunity. &ldquo;When your case is called on again,
show as much indifference about the result as you have hitherto shown
anxiety; then tell your adversary that during this interval, which you
spent in the shade of the woods, a Saligen Fraulein had appeared to you
and advised you not to use any of the milk the one who appeared to the
Senner had milked for you, because she was a mischievous one, and the
milk she milked was bewitched, so that all who drank of it, or of any
milk mixed with it&mdash;were it only one drop of it&mdash;would be
turned into asses. Then add, &lsquo;But of course, if your pailful is
really the milk of your own cow, you have nothing to fear; so
there&rsquo;s an end of the dispute.&rsquo; Then he will probably be so
frightened by the threat of this calamity that he will probably have
nothing more to do with the pail; and that will suffice to prove that
it is not the milk of his cow, and expose his deceit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The peasant was so delighted with the wise counsel that he hardly
knew how to thank his benefactress, and readily gave her the promise
she required of not letting any one know he had even seen her.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span></p>
<p>He had scarcely got back to the court when the case was called on
again. The peasant carried out the advice he had received with great
shrewdness, and found it answer completely. Every body applauded the
craft by which he had confounded his would-be oppressor, and the judge
himself was very much pleased to see the end of such a troublesome
case.</p>
<p>A few minutes&rsquo; thought, however, suggested to him that there
was more than a peasant&rsquo;s shrewdness in the matter, and he was
not slow to discern the guiding of his wife in it; so he called the
peasant apart, and had little difficulty in wringing from the simple
clown a confession of who had been his prompter.</p>
<p>The discovery made the judge set off homeward in great anger. His
wife had broken her promise&mdash;the fundamental condition of their
union; and he would have nothing more to say to her! Out of his house
she must go, whithersoever she would, but far away out of his
sight.</p>
<p>Katharina, who had so often calmed her father&rsquo;s anger by her
prudent reasoning, exerted herself to the utmost to bring her husband
back to a better mind; but in vain. And all the concessions he would
yield were, to consent that they should eat their last dinner together,
and that she should take away with her one thing out of the house,
whatever she had most fancy for. It was not much <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>to
obtain when required to part for ever from her home, and her hopes, and
all to which she had grown united and attached&mdash;but it was all she
could obtain.</p>
<p>Dinner-time came, and the judge, who was devotedly fond of his wife,
seemed lost in sorrow at the calamity about to befall him; still he
would not yield. Though she caressed him and entreated him to forgive
her, he still said he could not depart from his word, and he would not
allow her to speak of it. They sat down to their silent meal; and as
the time of separation drew nearer he grew more sombre and sad, and at
last determined to console himself with the red wine that sparkled by
his side. Katharina encouraged him to drink, and as his bottle got
exhausted deftly replaced it by a full one, so that he was quite
unconscious of the depth of his potations.</p>
<p>Presently the steward came into the room ready to drive Katharina to
whatever destination she should select, and, as he had heard it
stipulated that she was to take with her whatever she liked best,
proffered his services to assist in the removal&mdash;for she had won
the respect and affection of all her dependants, and they delighted to
be occupied for her.</p>
<p>Katharina rose to depart, thanked the man for his attention, and, in
answer to his question as to the object she would take with her,
pointed to her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>husband, who now lay helpless across his settle,
his head drooping over the table.</p>
<p>The steward could scarcely believe his eyes, but Katharina had a way
of giving orders which did not admit of being questioned. The first
surprise over, too, it struck him as a capital device, and he entered
heartily into the spirit of the scheme. With the help of a couple of
serving-men the judge was deposited safely in the lumbering old
carriage, and Katharina having taken her place beside him, they drove
away by her direction over one of the worst and most uneven roads in
the neighbourhood. The shaking of the vehicle presently awakened the
sleeper, who was, of course, quite at a loss to conceive where he was,
but, perceiving that he cut a rather silly figure, was ashamed to ask
his wife, who sat by his side as if there was nothing amiss, and said
nothing.</p>
<p>At last his curiosity got the better of his self-respect, and he
begged her to tell him what all this trundling and shaking meant.</p>
<p>Katharina in a few words recalled to him his cruel decree, at the
same time reminding him of his promise that she might take with her
what she liked best, and, throwing her arms round him, asked him if
there could be any doubt as to what <i>that</i> could be.</p>
<p>The judge perceived that his wife had once more shown her sense and
judgment, and was not sorry <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href=
"#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span>to find she had contrived this
opportunity of making up their difference. On renewing her petition for
forgiveness, he frankly gave her his pardon; and they drove back home
to live together in love and union to the end of their days.

<h3 class="main">THE GEESEHERDS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a peasant who had three sons, Karl,
Stefan, and Josef; but, as he was very poor, they often had scarcely
enough to eat, and were always complaining. So one day he told them
that they should go out, one at a time, into the world, and see whether
they could do better for themselves than he could do for them; and,
having drawn lots which should go first, it fell upon the youngest.</p>
<p>Josef was not altogether sorry to see a little of what the world was
made of, and started with break of day next morning on his travels. He
went begging about the country, but for a long time could find nothing
to make a living by. At last he came to a splendid mansion on the
borders of a large forest. When he asked his usual question, whether
there was any place vacant for him, the servants took him into the big
house; and, after conducting him through a number of apartments, each
more beautiful than the other, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254"
href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>was ushered into a vast hall,
all panelled round with carved wood, with windows of painted glass, and
filled with handsome furniture. Reclining in an easy-chair, sat an aged
nobleman, the owner of the mansion, who, when he heard Josef&rsquo;s
request, took compassion on him, and told him he would take him into
his service, beginning with giving him a very easy employment, and if
he proved himself faithful in that, he would promote him to something
higher. At first, then, he would only have to keep his geese; but there
was one condition he would bid him observe.</p>
<p>Josef was so delighted with the prospect that he hastily interposed
a promise of obeying it, before it was even uttered.</p>
<p>And that condition was, that if at any time he should hear any music
or singing in the forest, he should never listen to it, however much he
might be inclined, for that if he did, he would inevitably lose his
place.</p>
<p>Josef repeated his promise, and swore that he would never listen to
the music. He was then led down to the place where the other servants
were gathered for supper, and as there was a whole crowd of them, and
plenty of good food and drink, Josef began to think that he had fallen
on to his feet indeed!</p>
<p>After supper, Josef was shown into a tidy little room as big as his
father&rsquo;s whole cottage, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255"
href="#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>where was a nice little white
bed, and a suit of clothes ready to put on when he got up. Though Josef
liked good food and a good bed, he was by no means an idle boy, but
rose very early in the morning for his new employment; and, having
received from the cook his breakfast, and his wallet of provisions for
the midday meal, turned out the geese, and drove them before him to the
meadow skirting the forest.</p>
<p>Josef had never seen so many geese together before, and all the
morning long he was never tired of looking at them, and counting them,
observing their ways, fancying he discerned various peculiarities in
each, by which to know one from another henceforth; and he began to
give them all different names. When one showed an inclination to stray,
what fun it was to drive her back, and see her flap her great, soft,
white, awkward wings, and stretch out her great yellow bill, as with
awkward gait she shambled back to the flock! So the morning went by;
and it was long past the hour of dinner before Josef found any need of
it, but when he did, he was astonished at the abundant supply which had
been provided for him. &ldquo;Truly, I did well to come out into the
world,&rdquo; he thought, as he lounged upon the greensward, eating the
good food. &ldquo;What a contrast between having this splendid mansion
to live in, and my father&rsquo;s poor cabin; between the dry crusts we
had to eat there, and the princely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256"
href="#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span>food allowed to us here;
between the toil and slavery there, and this easy kind of work, which
might more properly be called a pastime! My father thought to punish me
for grumbling, he would be astonished if he could see what a fine
exchange I have made!&rdquo; and he laughed aloud, though all alone.
But presently the effects of the full meal, the heat of the afternoon,
and the excitement of his new position brought on sensations of
lassitude and somnolence&mdash;and soon you might have seen him
stretched upon the grass at full length, and snoring to his
heart&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>It is uncertain how long he had slept, but erewhile his slumber was
disturbed by the sound of the most enchanting strains of music. Josef
raised himself on his elbow, and listened; he had never imagined any
thing so beautiful! and when he had listened a little while, he grew so
rapt that he could not forbear going a little way into the forest to
hear it better, and then a little farther, and farther, till, by the
time it ceased, he was a long way from his charge. Then, as he
perceived this, for the first time he remembered the condition his
master had laid upon him, and his own positive promise to observe it!
In shame and confusion he hasted back; but in place of his splendid
flock of geese, there were but half a dozen, and those the worst
favoured, to be seen! It was vain he called after them, and tore his
hair, and ran hither and thither&mdash;no <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb257" href="#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>geese appeared! and
as it began to get dark, he found his best plan was to hurry home with
the few that remained.</p>
<p>When he arrived a servant was waiting to conduct him to the master.
He no longer wore the benevolent smile with which he had first
instructed Josef in the terms of his service. He looked so black and
angry that the boy was frightened to approach him&mdash;too frightened
to find a word in his defence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had pity on you,&rdquo; said the master, &ldquo;because you
entreated me to try you: you have broken your word, and I can trust you
no more. I told you the penalty; now you have chosen to incur it, you
must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josef could do nothing at first but cry, as he contemplated this
sudden extinction of his dreams of ease and plenty, but he took courage
to throw himself on his knees, and entreat one more trial. The master
was inexorable&mdash;only, as he was rich and generous, he would not
let him go away empty-handed, and he took out of a casket before him a
gold pin, as a memorial of his good intention, and dismissed the boy
with a gesture which admitted of no further parleying.</p>
<p>Josef was allowed to sleep in the mansion that night, but the next
morning, instead of carrying on his agreeable occupation of geeseherd,
he had to leave the place ignominiously, his rags being <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>returned to him in place of the smart livery of
the castle. Uncertain whither next to bend his steps, he determined to
go home in the first instance and show his gold pin, and then take a
fresh start in search of another chance.</p>
<p>As he toiled up a steep Joch<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4011src"
href="#xd21e4011" name="xd21e4011src">70</a>, feeling so thirsty that
his eyes went searching every where for a cottage where he might beg a
sup of milk, a hay-maker turned off the Hoch Alp<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4016src" href="#xd21e4016" name="xd21e4016src">71</a> on to the
road just in front of him, with a cartload of hay he was hastening to
take home before rain fell. But, for all his urging, the oxen could not
turn the cart, and there it stuck in the edge of the road. Seeing our
stout youth coming along, the man called to him to help him lift the
wheel, promising him a bowl of milk in return. Josef was a good-natured
lad, and, as we have said, by no means indisposed for exertion, so he
set to work with a will, and the team was very soon put in motion. He
travelled on by the side of the cart, and when they reached the Hof for
which it was destined, Josef received a bowl of milk, which refreshed
him for the rest of the journey.</p>
<p>As he got near his father&rsquo;s cottage he went to take out the
gold pin with glee, to have it ready to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb259" href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>display. Great was
his vexation, therefore, at discovering he had it no longer&mdash;nor
could his searching bring it back any more than the geese! Josef burst
into tears, and joined the family meal at home, which was just prepared
as he arrived, with his head low bowed, as if he sought to hide himself
for very shame.</p>
<p>When his father saw him in such melancholy plight, his compassion
warmed to him, and he asked him kindly what had befallen. Josef told
all his adventures, crying afresh as he came to the narration of how he
had lost on the way the gold pin, to display which he had come home
before starting in search of another chance of employment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such chances don&rsquo;t grow as thick as
black-berries,&rdquo; said Stefan, the second son: &ldquo;instead of
your going in search of another, I&rsquo;ll go to the same grand house;
and <i>I</i> won&rsquo;t lose such a fine situation for the sake of
&lsquo;tweedle-dum,&rsquo; I can tell you! And whatever I get for
wages, you may depend, I won&rsquo;t stick it in my belt where it is
sure to be brushed away, but on the brim of my hat, to be
sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josef, who had had enough of trying to provide for himself, and was
not sorry to be at home again, even with its scanty means, made no
objection, and their father, thinking it well Stefan should have
<i>his</i> experience of life too, approved the plan.</p>
<p>Stefan set out next morning, therefore; and by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>following Josef&rsquo;s directions soon
discovered the stately palace for which he was bound. The noble owner
received him as kindly as Josef, and sent him out to the same
employment, first binding him to observe the same condition. Stefan
readily promised to keep it, and was formally installed into his office
of geeseherd.</p>
<p>All went well enough at first, as with Josef; but it was at an even
earlier period of the day than with him that his curiosity was roused
by the fairy-like music. Then he, too, followed it through the forest;
and when it ceased at sound of the church bells ringing the <i>Ave</i>,
he found not more than three or four geese left of all his flock!</p>
<p>On his return the master was full of anger at his breach of trust,
and inexorably resolved to turn him away; but not to let him go
empty-handed, he gave him a little lamb to take home.</p>
<p>Stefan was pleased enough with his prize, but was somewhat
embarrassed as to the manner of carrying it safely home. He had
declared that whatever he got he would bring home on his hat, and
though he had never thought of so embarrassing a present falling to
him, at the time he spoke, he resolved to keep his word, and so used
his best endeavours to fix the little creature round the brim.</p>
<p>He carried it thus great part of the way in safety, but having to
cross a somewhat rapid stream, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261"
href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span>a projecting bough of a tree
lifted his hat from his head&mdash;and both hat and lamb fell in, and
were carried fast away by the torrent!</p>
<p>Stefan came back even more crestfallen than Josef; and, having told
his story, Karl, the eldest, with great indignation at the carelessness
of his brothers, declared that he would make the trial next. He would
not stick his prize in his belt or his hat, not he! he would carry it
by a string, and then it couldn&rsquo;t get loose; and as for the
music, he had no fear of being led away by that. Josef, indeed, had had
some excuse, as the strains took him by surprise, but to be so foolish
as Stefan, after the warning example of another, was perfectly
contemptible. <i>He</i> couldn&rsquo;t be so silly as <i>that</i>, not
he!</p>
<p>He started on his way betimes, and toiled along not without some
misgivings lest he should find so good a post already occupied by
another. But it was not so: the owner of the mansion gave him the same
reception, the same charge, and the same warning as the other two; and,
full of confidence in his superiority, he went forth to his work.</p>
<p>The weather was cool, and he had no need to seek the shade of the
forest trees; and for more than a week he brought the full tale of
geese home day by day. &ldquo;What idiots those were to throw away
their place for the sake of a little music!&rdquo; he thought to
himself one day later. &ldquo;I told them I should not be so
foolish&mdash;not I! I told them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262"
href="#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>I shouldn&rsquo;t be led away
by it, and I haven&rsquo;t been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was hotter that day, and in the afternoon, when the
sun&rsquo;s power was greatest&mdash;forgetting the warning of his
brothers&rsquo; example, or rather setting it at defiance, with the
assurance that though he sought the shade he need not listen to the
music&mdash;he crept within the border of the cool forest, and lay
down.</p>
<p>He had hardly done so when his senses were rapt by the delicious but
deceitful strains. &ldquo;The woods must be full of fairies!&rdquo; he
cried; &ldquo;this can be no earthly music&mdash;I must follow it up
and see what manner of instruments they are, for never on earth was
heard the like!&rdquo; But as he went on, the music always seemed
farther off, and farther again, till at last the church bells rang the
<i>Ave</i>, and the music ceased.</p>
<p>Then Karl woke to a sense of his weakness and folly; and though he
ran every step of the way back to his geese, only two were there!
Though he had now found the same fate befall himself as his brothers,
in all particulars, yet he could not forbear searching for the lost
geese; but of course it was in vain, and he had to return to the castle
with but two. Nothing could look more miserable, or more ludicrous,
than this diminished procession&mdash;Karl at the head of his two
geese, who had gone out in the morning with such a goodly flock.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span></p>
<p>He would have gladly slunk away without exchanging a word with any
one, but he could not escape being taken before the master, who scolded
him in the same words in which he had chided his brothers, but gave him
a fine rich cake to take home.</p>
<p>The cake was round, and it was very inconvenient to attempt to
secure it by means of a string, but Karl had declared he would bring
home his reward that way, and so it was a point of honour with him to
do it. But passing by a Hof, on his way home, where was a large and
powerful watch-dog on guard, he set off running to escape its grip.
This was the very way to attract the beast&rsquo;s notice, however; and
off it set in pursuit, much faster than Karl&rsquo;s legs could carry
him away&mdash;and then, having jumped upon him and knocked him down,
seized his cake, and devoured it before his eyes!</p>
<p>Karl had now to go home as empty-handed as his brothers, and as full
of tears; but his father comforted him, and checked the rising gibe of
his youngers by reminding them that all had failed equally; so they all
joined in a good-humoured laugh in which there was nothing of
bitterness.</p>
<p>The father then asked them if any of them wished to go out into the
world and seek fortune again; but they all agreed that there was
nothing to be gained by the move, and that though there were positions
which at first sight seemed more <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264"
href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>brilliant and more delectable
than their own, yet that each had its compensatory trials, and that
they were best where God had placed them.</p>
<p>Henceforth, however, they were ashamed of renewing their grumblings,
but, each making the best of his lot, they became noted as the most
contented and, therefore, happiest family of the whole valley.

<h3 class="main">ST. PETER&rsquo;S THREE LOAVES<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4095src" href="#xd21e4095" name="xd21e4095src">72</a>.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the days when our Lord and Saviour walked this
earth with His apostles, it happened one day that He was passing, with
St. Peter for His companion, through a secluded valley, and that
discoursing, as was His wont, of the things of the Kingdom of God, and
raising the mind of His disciple from the earthly to the heavenly, they
noticed not how the hours <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href=
"#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span>went by. Nevertheless, they had
been walking since daybreak over rough mountain tracks and across
swollen torrents many a weary mile, and had eaten nothing all day, for
their way had led them far from the haunts of men; but as noon came
down upon them they approached the precincts of a scattered hamlet. The
bells of all the large farm-houses were ringing to call in the
labourers from the field to their midday meal, and announced a
community of sensations in the world around akin to those with which
St. Peter had for a long time past been tormented. The heat increased,
and the way grew more weary, and St. Peter found it more and more
difficult to keep his attention alive to his Master&rsquo;s
teaching.</p>
<p>The merciful Saviour was not slow to perceive what ailed His
disciple, and kept on the look-out for any opportunity of satisfying
him as anxiously as if the need had been His own; and thus, while St.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span>Peter was still wondering how long he would have
to go on fasting, He remarked to him the smell of fresh-baked loaves
proceeding from a cottage at the bottom of the valley.</p>
<p>St. Peter could as yet perceive neither the scent nor the cottage.
Nevertheless, used as he was to trust his Lord&rsquo;s word implicitly,
he started at His bidding, following the direction pointed out just as
if both had been patent to himself.</p>
<p>The way was so steep and rough that St. Peter, in his eagerness, had
many falls, but at last, without much damage, reached nearly the foot
of the mountain range along the side of which they had been journeying;
and then suddenly the smell of a wood fire, mingled with the welcome
odour of fresh-baked bread, greeted him. The roof of the cottage was
just beneath his feet, and the smoke was curling up through the
chimney, telling of a well-provided stove, burning to good purpose,
close at hand. One or two more winds of the road, and only one more
slip over the loose stones, brought him to the door.</p>
<p>A comely peasant wife opened it at his knock with a cheerful
greeting: &ldquo;<i lang="de">Gelobt sei Jesus Christus<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4116src" href="#xd21e4116" name=
"xd21e4116src">73</a>!</i>&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268"
href="#pb268" name="pb268">268</a>]</span></p>
<p>The apostle, having given the customary response, &ldquo;<i lang=
"de">In Ewigkeit! Amen</i>,&rdquo; the peasant wife asked him to come
in and rest&mdash;an offer which St. Peter gladly accepted.</p>
<p>The peasant woman wiped a chair, and presented it to him, and, with
some pleasant words about his journey, returned to her occupation at
the fire. The moment had just arrived when she should take her loaves
from the oven, and nothing could smell more tempting to a man whose
appetite was seasoned by a long walk in the fresh mountain air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good woman, I come from far, and the whole of this blessed
morning,&rdquo; he exclaimed, speaking as one of the people, &ldquo;I
have tasted nothing! ... nor my companion,&rdquo; he added, with some
embarrassment lest he should seem encroaching, yet full of anxiety to
provide for his Master&rsquo;s needs as well as his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tasted nothing all this morning!&rdquo; exclaimed the
compassionate peasant wife, scarcely leaving him time to speak;
&ldquo;poor soul! Why didn&rsquo;t you say so at first? Here, take one
of these loaves; they are the best I have, and, if humble fare, are at
all events quite fresh. And your companion too, did you say? Take one
for him also;&rdquo; and then, as if she found so much pleasure in the
exercise of hospitality that she could not refrain from indulging it
further, she added, &ldquo;and take this one too, if you will; maybe
you may want it before the journey is out.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span></p>
<p>St. Peter thanked her heartily for her generosity, and hasted to
take the loaves to the Master, that He might bless and break them. But
as they were hot, being just out of the oven, he had to wrap them in
the folds of his coarse grey mantle, to be able to hold them without
burning his hands.</p>
<p>As he toiled up the steep, the thought came to him, &ldquo;It will
most likely be long before we have a chance of meeting with provisions
again, and I always seem to want food sooner than the Master; I might
very well keep this third loaf under my cloak, and then in the night,
while He is lost in heavenly contemplation, and I am perishing with
hunger, I shall have something to satisfy it. I do Him no wrong, for He
never feels these privations as I do&mdash;at all events,&rdquo; he
added, with some misgivings, &ldquo;He never <i>seems</i>
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he reached the place where he had left the Saviour. He was
still kneeling beneath the shade of a knoll of pines. As St. Peter
approached, however, though He was not turned so as to see him coming,
He rose, as if He knew of his presence, and, coming to meet him, asked
him cheerfully what success he had in his catering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent success, Lord,&rdquo; replied St. Peter. &ldquo;I
arrived just at the right moment. The woman was taking the loaves out
of the oven, and, being a good-hearted soul, she gave me one; and when
I told her I had a companion with me, she gave me another, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span>without requiring any proof of the assertion; so
come, and let us break our fast, for it is time.&rdquo; But he said no
word about the third loaf, which he kept tight in a fold of his mantle
under his arm.</p>
<p>They sat down on a rock by the side of a sparkling rivulet, hasting
along its way to swell the far-off river, and its cool crystal waters
supplied the nectar of their meal.</p>
<p>St. Peter, who had now long studied in the school of mortification
of his Master, was quite satisfied with this frugal repast, and, no
longer tortured by the cravings of nature, listened with all his wonted
delight and enthusiasm to every word which fell from the Lord&rsquo;s
lips, treasuring them up that not one might be lost. It was true that
he could not suppress some little embarrassment when the thought of the
third loaf occurred to him; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said, to himself,
&ldquo;there could be no possible harm in it; the woman had clearly
given it to him; his Lord didn&rsquo;t want it, and he was only keeping
it for his needs. True, if <i>He</i> were to suspect it, He would not
quite like that; but then, why should He? He never suspects any
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never had the Saviour been more familiar, more confiding. St. Peter
felt the full charm of His presence and forgot all his misgivings, and
the cause of them, too, in the joy of listening to Him. Then came a
friendly bird, and hopped round Him, feeding on the crumbs that had
fallen. The Saviour, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271"
name="pb271">271</a>]</span>as He watched its eagerness, fed it with
pieces from His own loaf. Another bird was attracted at the
sight&mdash;another, and another, and another, till there was a whole
flock gathered round. The Saviour fed them all, and yet He seemed to
take His own meal too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just as I thought,&rdquo; St. Peter reasoned with
himself; &ldquo;His needs are not as our needs. Decidedly I do Him no
wrong in keeping the loaf for my own.&rdquo; And he felt quite at
ease.</p>
<p>The simple repast was at an end; the birds chirped their thanks and
flew away; and the disciple and the Master rose from their rocky
seat.</p>
<p>St. Peter, leaning on his staff, set out to resume the journey, but
the Lord called him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Father in heaven has fed us well, shall we not thank Him
as is our wont?&rdquo;</p>
<p>St. Peter laid aside his staff, and cheerfully knelt down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as He has dealt with particular loving-kindness in the
abundance with which He has provided us this day, let us address Him
with arms outstretched, in token of the earnestness of our
gratitude,&rdquo; continued the Saviour; and as He spoke He flung His
arms wide abroad, as if embracing the whole universe and its Creator,
with an expression of ineffable love.</p>
<p>He knelt opposite St. Peter, who was not wont to be slow in
following such an exhortation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272"
href="#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;He only suggested it; He didn&rsquo;t command.&rdquo;
reasoned St. Peter to himself. &ldquo;I need not do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But a furtive glance he could not repress, met the Master&rsquo;s
eye fixed upon him with its whole wonted affection&mdash;there was no
resisting the appeal. With the spontaneity of habitual compliance, he
raised his arms after the pattern of his Lord; but the loaf, set free
by the motion, fell heavily to the ground beneath the Master&rsquo;s
eye.</p>
<p>The Master continued praying, as though He had perceived nothing,
but St. Peter&rsquo;s cheeks were suffused with a glow of shame; and
before they proceeded farther he had told Him all. <span class=

<h3 class="main">THE TWO COUSINS OF ST. PETER<a class="noteref" id=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">St. Peter had two young cousins whom he sought to
bring up in the way of righteousness according to Christian doctrine.
As they were very docile, and listened gladly to his word, he strove to
lead them in the way of all perfection; and to this end counselled them
to give themselves up entirely to serve God in a community of His
handmaidens, where they should live for the Divine spouse of their
souls, and for Him alone.</p>
<p>The work of the Church called St. Peter away from the East, and he
was already gone to establish the faith in Rome before the maidens had
decided as to their vocation. It was not till many years after that St.
Peter heard, to his surprise, on occasion of St. Timothy coming to
visit St. Paul in Rome, that while the youngest indeed had fulfilled
his expectations, and had given herself up to the religious
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>life, the elder had married and established
herself in the world, and become the mother of a large family.</p>
<p>During his long confinement in the dark dungeon of the Mamertine
prison, St. Peter&rsquo;s thoughts would often revert from the immense
cares of his sublime office to the quiet hours he had passed in the
lowly dwelling by the Lake of Tiberias, where his pious cousins had so
often sat at his feet listening to his instructions. And he found a
peaceful pleasure in recalling the way in which they had responded to
them; the spontaneity with which they had apprehended the maxims of the
new religion; their fervour in applying them to their own rule of life;
their readiness to go beyond what was bidden them, that so they might
testify their love for their Divine Master; their delight in all that
reminded them of God and His law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think that one of them should have gone back from all
this! should have been content to give up these exalted aspirations!
How sadly her ardour must have cooled! What could have worked this
change?&rdquo; the apostle would muse, in his distress, and pray
silently for her forgiveness and guidance; but his thoughts would
revert with greater affection and satisfaction to the more favoured
state of the soul of the younger sister.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>It was not long before the terrible decree of Nero consigning St.
Peter to the death of the cross was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb275" href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>pronounced, and from
the height of the Janiculum he was received into the celestial mansion
to keep the gate of the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
<p>He had not exercised this office many years when our Lord called him
to Him one day, and bid him open the gate of heaven to its widest
stretch and deck its approaches as for a high festival, for that one of
the holiest of earth and the dearest to Himself was to be received into
the abode of the Blessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be my youngest cousin,&rdquo; said St. Peter,
&ldquo;there is no doubt; she who generously gave up a world in which
she was so well adapted to shine, to live a life of perfection with God
above only for its object;&rdquo; and he strained his eyes to see far
along the approach to Paradise, that he might catch the first glimpse
of her glorified soul and greet it with the earliest welcome.</p>
<p>How great was his surprise then, when roused by the melodious
strains of the angelic host escorting her, to hear in the refrain of
their chant the name of the <i>Sorellona</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4211src" href="#xd21e4211" name="xd21e4211src">75</a>, not of the
younger of the sisters! Meantime the celestial cort&eacute;ge was
wafted by, and the beautiful spirit was welcomed by the Divine Master
Himself, and placed on one of the highest seats in His kingdom.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span></p>
<p>Not many days after our Lord called St. Peter to Him again, and told
him to open the gate a little, very little way, and to make no
preparations for rejoicing, for He had promised admission to a soul
who, though of his family, yet had only escaped being excluded by a
hair&rsquo;s breadth.</p>
<p>St. Peter went away perplexed, for he knew there was no one of his
family who could be coming to heaven just at that time except the
younger of the two cousins, and how could the Lord&rsquo;s words apply
to <i>her</i>?</p>
<p>He durst do no more than open the gate a very little way, but
stationed himself opposite that small cleft to obtain the earliest
information as to who the new comer really was.</p>
<p>Presently a solitary angel came soaring&mdash;the only escort of a
trembling soul&mdash;and, as he approached, without chorus or melody,
he begged admission for one whom, by the name, St. Peter discerned was
actually the <i>Sorellotta</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e4234src"
href="#xd21e4234" name="xd21e4234src">76</a> he had deemed so
meritorious! With great difficulty, and by the help of the angel who
conducted her, and of St. Peter himself, she succeeded in passing the
sacred portal; and after she had been led to the footstool of the
Heavenly Throne in silence, He who sat on it pointed to a very little,
low, distant seat, as the one assigned to her.</p>
<p>When St. Peter afterwards came to discourse with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span>the
Lord about His dealings with the two souls, he learnt that she who
performed her duty with great exactness and perfection in the world was
more pleasing in His sight than she who, while straining after the
fulfilment of a higher rule, yet fell short of correspondence with so
great a grace. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=

<h3 class="main">LUXEHALE&rsquo;S WIVES.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Devil goes wandering over the earth in many
disguises, and that not only to hunt souls; sometimes it is to choose
for himself a wife, but when he goes on these expeditions he calls
himself &ldquo;Luxehale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was once a very beautiful princess, very proud of her beauty,
who had vowed she would never marry any but the handsomest prince.
Numbers of princes, who heard the fame of her beauty, came to ask her
hand, but directly she saw them she declared they were not handsome
enough for her, and drove them out of the city. Her parents were in
despair, for there was scarcely any young prince left in the world whom
she had not thus rejected.</p>
<p>One day the trumpeters sounded the call by which they were wont to
announce the arrival of a visitor.</p>
<p>The princess sat with her mother in an arbour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the queen, &ldquo;there is another come to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>ask your hand. How I wish he may be the really
handsome one you desire, this time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all useless, mother; I don&rsquo;t mean to see any more
of them&mdash;they are all uglier, one than the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The queen was about to answer by instancing several noted paragons
of manly beauty whom she had rejected like the rest, but the
chamberlain came in with great importance just at that moment, to say
that the prince who had just arrived appeared to be a very great prince
indeed, and that he was in a great hurry, and demanded to see the
princess instantly.</p>
<p>The princess was very indignant at this abrupt proposal, and refused
absolutely to see him; but at last the queen got her to consent to
place herself in a hollow pillar in the great reception-hall, and
through a little peephole, contrived in the decorations, take a view of
him without his knowing that she did so.</p>
<p>When the princess thus saw the stranger, she was dazzled with the
perfection of his form and the surpassing beauty of his countenance,
and she could hardly restrain herself from darting from her
hiding-place and offering him her hand at once; in order to preserve
herself from committing such a mistake, she immediately let herself
down through a little trap-door into the room below, where it had been
agreed that her mother should meet her. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb280" href="#pb280" name="pb280">280</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what did you think of him?&rdquo; said the queen, who
did not keep her long waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I think he <i>might</i> do,&rdquo; said the princess,
with an assumed air of indifference, for she was too proud to
acknowledge how much she admired him.</p>
<p>The queen was overjoyed that at length she consented to marry, and
so put an end to the anxiety she was in to see her established before
she died. That she might not take it into her head to go back from what
she had said, her parents hastened on the wedding preparations, and the
prince seemed very anxious, too, that no delay should occur. As soon as
the festivities were over, he handed his bride into a magnificent gold
coach, and drove off with her, followed by a retinue which showed he
was a very great prince indeed.</p>
<p>Away they rode many days&rsquo; journey, till at last they reached a
palace of greater magnificence than any thing the princess had ever
conceived, filled with crowds of servants, who fulfilled her least wish
almost before it was uttered, and where every pleasure and every
gratification was provided for her in abundance.</p>
<p>The prince took great pleasure in conducting her frequently over
every part of the palace, and it was so vast that, after she had been
over it many times, there was still much which seemed strange to her;
but what was strangest of all was, there was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>one
high door, all of adamant, which the prince never opened, and the only
cross word he had spoken to her was once when she had asked him whither
it led.</p>
<p>After some time it happened that the prince had to go on a
considerable journey, and before he left he confided to his wife the
keys of all the apartments in the palace, but she observed the key of
the adamant door was not among them, and ventured to ask why it was
not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because no one passes through that door but myself; and I
advise you not to think any thing more about that door, or you may be
sure you will repent it,&rdquo; and he spoke very sternly and
positively.</p>
<p>This only whetted her curiosity still more; and she was no sooner
sure he was at a safe distance, than she determined to go down and see
if some of the keys would not open this door. The first she tried in it
showed there was no need of any, for it was unlocked, and pushed open
at her touch. It gave entrance to a long underground passage, which
received a strange lurid light from the opening at the far end.</p>
<p>The princess pursued the ominous corridor with beating heart; and,
when she reached the other end, made the frightful discovery that it
was&mdash;the entrance to hell!</p>
<p>Without losing a moment, she rushed up-stairs, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>regained her own apartment, and sat down to
contrive her escape, for she now perceived that it was the Devil,
disguised as a beautiful prince, that she had married!</p>
<p>As she sat, pursued by a thousand agonizing thoughts, the gentle
cooing of two pigeons in a cage soothed her, and reminded her of
home.</p>
<p>Her father&rsquo;s fondness had suggested that she should take the
birds with her that she might have the means of communicating to him
how it fared with her in her married home. Quickly she now wrote a note
to tell him of the discovery she had made, and begging him to deliver
her. She tied the note to one of the pigeons, and let them fly.</p>
<p>The Devil came back in the same disguise, and was profuse in his
caresses; and he never thought of her having opened the door. But all
the princess&rsquo;s affection and admiration for him were gone, and it
was with the greatest difficulty she contrived to keep up an appearance
of the fondness she had formerly so warmly and so sincerely
lavished.</p>
<p>Meantime the pigeons went on their way, and brought the note home.
The king and queen were having dinner on the terrace, and with them sat
a young stranger, named Berthold, conversing with them, but too sad to
taste the food before him. He was one of those the princess had
rejected without seeing, but as he had seen her, he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span>was
deeply distressed at the present separation. The pigeons flew tamely in
narrowing circles round the king&rsquo;s head, and, at last, the one
which carried the note came fluttering on to the table before him. He
would have driven them away, the rather, that they were all distressed
and bleeding, and with scarcely a feather left, but the young
stranger&rsquo;s eye discovered the note, which was quickly opened and
read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, help me! What can I do?&rdquo; exclaimed the king;
&ldquo;give me some counsel. How can I ever reach the Devil&rsquo;s
palace&mdash;and how could I fight him, if even I did get
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I be permitted to undertake the deliverance?&rdquo; asked
the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, in heaven&rsquo;s name, yes!&rdquo; cried the king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And shall I have your permission to pay my addresses to her
when I bring her back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she will be yours&mdash;yours of right, if you succeed
in rescuing her; altogether yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must depend on herself. Nevertheless, if I have your
consent to ask her in marriage, that is all I desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, and succeed!&rdquo; devoutly exclaimed the king.
&ldquo;And whatever you stand in need of, be it men or money, or arms,
you have but to command, and every thing shall be given you that you
require.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the prince, who knew not what sort of enemy he had to encounter,
or which way he had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284"
name="pb284">284</a>]</span>to go, knew not what assistance to ask for,
but set out, trusting in God and his own good sense to guide him.</p>
<p>As he passed out of the castle enclosure his eyes were rejoiced to
see lying on the ground some of the white feathers of the
carrier-pigeons, and then he perceived that, not having been duly
matched, they had fought all the way, and that the whole track was
marked with their feathers. But as they, of course, had come by the
directest course, it led him over steep precipices and wild,
unfrequented places; still Berthold pursued his way through all
difficulties without losing courage, and ever as he went pondering in
his own mind with what arts he should meet the Devil.</p>
<p>He was passing through a desolate stony place, which seemed far from
any habitations of men, when he saw a man crouching by the wayside,
with his ear close against the rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing there?&rdquo; said Berthold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am listening to what is going on in the Devil&rsquo;s
house,&rdquo; answered the man, &ldquo;for my sense of hearing is so
fine, it carries as far as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come with me,&rdquo; said Berthold; &ldquo;I will find
work for you which shall be well repaid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the man left off listening, and walked on behind him.</p>
<p>A little farther on, he observed a man sitting on a ledge of the
precipice, with his back to the road, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb285" href="#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span>and with all the
world before him; and he gazed out into the far distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you staring at?&rdquo; said Berthold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am gazing into the Devil&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; said the
man, &ldquo;for my sight is so sharp, it carries as far as
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come along with me; I will give your eyes work that
shall be well paid<span class="corr" id="xd21e4346" title=
"Source: :">.</span>&rdquo; said Berthold.</p>
<p>So the man left off gazing, and turned and walked behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But stop!&rdquo; said the prince; &ldquo;let me have some
little proof that you are as clever as you say. If you can see and hear
into the Devil&rsquo;s house, let me know what the Devil&rsquo;s wife
is doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the first man crouched down with his ear against the rock; and
the second man sat himself astride on a jutting projection of the
precipice, and gazed abroad over the open space&mdash;Berthold taking
care that they should be far enough apart not to communicate with each
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo; he said, when the second man had
poised himself to his own satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see a vast apartment, all of shining crystal, and the Devil
lying fast asleep on a ledge of the flaming spar, while the
Devil&rsquo;s wife sits with averted face, and weeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do <i>you</i> hear?&rdquo; he said, returning to the
first man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear the Devil snore like the roaring of a wild
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span>beast, and I hear great sighs of a soft
woman&rsquo;s voice; and every now and then she says, &lsquo;Why was I
so foolish and haughty, as to send away all those noble princes whom I
might have learnt to love? and above all, Berthold, whom I would not
see, and who my mother said was better than them all; and I would not
see him! If I could but see him now, how I would love him!<span class=
"corr" id="xd21e4369" title="Not in source">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Berthold heard that, he could not rest a minute longer, but
told them he was satisfied; and hurried on so fast that they could
scarce keep up with him.</p>
<p>On they went thus; and presently they saw a man amusing himself with
lifting great boulders of rock, which he did so deftly that no one
could hear him move them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a rare talent,&rdquo; said Berthold; &ldquo;come
along with me, and I will pay your service well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the man put down a great mass of rock he had in his arms, and
walked on behind the prince.</p>
<p>Presently there were no more pigeons&rsquo; feathers to be seen, and
Berthold wrung his hands in despair at losing the track.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; said the man with the sharp sight, &ldquo;there
they lie, all down this steep, and along yonder valley, and over that
high mountain! it will take three months to traverse that
valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is impossible to follow along there at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>all!&rdquo; cried all the men. But Berthold said
they must find their way somehow.</p>
<p>While they were looking about to find a path to descend by, they saw
a great eagle soaring round and round, flapping her wings, and uttering
plaintive cries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what&rsquo;s the matter,&rdquo; said the
man with the sharp hearing: &ldquo;one of her eggs has fallen down this
ledge, and it is too narrow for her to get it out; I can hear the heart
of the eaglet beating through the shell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eagle,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;if I take out your egg,
and give it to you, will you do something for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, any thing!&rdquo; said the eagle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that is a hot, sunny ledge,&rdquo; said the prince;
&ldquo;your egg won&rsquo;t hurt there till we come back&mdash;I have
seen in my travels some birds which hatch their eggs entirely in the
hot sand. Now you take us all on your back, and fly with us along the
track wherever you see the pigeons&rsquo; feathers, and wait a few
minutes while we complete our business there, and then bring us back;
and then I&rsquo;ll take your egg out of the fissure for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not much to do!&rdquo; said the eagle;
&ldquo;jump up, all of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they all got on the eagle&rsquo;s back, the prince taking care so
to arrange his men that the great neck and outstretched wings of the
eagle should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>hide them from the Devil&rsquo;s sight, should
he have happened to be outside his house.</p>
<p>It took the eagle only two or three hours to reach the
journey&rsquo;s end, and by this time it was night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now it is dark,&rdquo; said Berthold, to the
sharp-visioned man, as they alighted from the eagle&rsquo;s back,
&ldquo;you cannot help us any more with your sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; the crystals of the Devil&rsquo;s apartment always
glitter with the same red glare by night or day. I see the Devil rolled
up in bed fast asleep, and his wife sits on a chair by his side, and
weeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you hear?&rdquo; he said, addressing the first
attendant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear snoring and weeping, as before,&rdquo; said the man
addressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you, who are so clever at lifting weights without being
heard,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;lift the great door off its
hinges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; replied the man, a minute later,
for he had done it so quietly Berthold was not aware he had moved from
the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you have done this so well, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll
do the next job. You have now to go up into the Devil&rsquo;s room, and
bring the lady down without the least noise; if you show her this
token, she will recognize it for her father&rsquo;s device, and will
come with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sharp-visioned man told him how he would <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span>have
to go, for he could see all the inside of the house, lighted up as it
was with the glaring crystals. But just as he was about to
start,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried the man with the sharp ears; &ldquo;I hear
the Devil turn in his bed; our talking must have disturbed him.&rdquo;
So they all stood stock still in great fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to be getting up,&rdquo; whispered the man with the
sharp sight. &ldquo;No; now he has turned round and rolled himself up
once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now he is snoring again,&rdquo; continued the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we may proceed,&rdquo; replied the prince; and the third
attendant went his way so softly that no one heard him go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up on the eagle&rsquo;s back,&rdquo; said Berthold to the
other two, &ldquo;that we may be ready to start immediately.&rdquo; So
the men took their places.</p>
<p>They had hardly done so when the man came back bearing the princess,
and at a sign from Berthold sprang with her on to the eagle&rsquo;s
neck. The prince got up behind, and away flew the eagle&mdash;so
swiftly that had he been less collected he might have lost his balance
before he had secured his seat.</p>
<p>By daybreak they had reached the spot where the eagle&rsquo;s egg
had fallen. Berthold willingly exerted himself to restore her treasure
to her, and she was so grateful that she proposed to fly with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>them home the remainder of the journey&mdash;an
offer which they gladly accepted.</p>
<p>The Devil was still sleeping and snoring, they were assured by the
clever attendants; and away they sped, reaching home just as the king
and queen were sitting down to breakfast.</p>
<p>Great was the rejoicing in all the palace. The princess gladly
acknowledged Berthold&rsquo;s service by giving him her hand; and to
all three attendants high offices were given at court. To the eagle was
offered a gold cage and two attendants to wait on her, but she
preferred liberty on her own high mountain, and flew away, accepting no
reward but a lamb to carry home to her young ones.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>When Luxehale woke next morning great was his fury to find that the
princess was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Order out a troop of horse, and send and demolish her palace,
and kill all belonging to her, and bring her home again,&rdquo; was the
advice of his chamberlain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Luxehale; &ldquo;I hate violence: I have
other ways at command which I find answer better. There are people
enough in the world glad enough to follow me willingly. It is not worth
while to give myself much trouble with those who resist.&rdquo; And he
dressed himself, and walked out.</p>
<p>This time his steps were not directed towards a grand palace. He
didn&rsquo;t care particularly about <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb291" href="#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span>birth or cultivation.
There was a cottage situated just above one of the alleys of his
pleasure-grounds where lived three beautiful peasant girls with an old
father. Luxehale had often listened to their merry laugh and thought
how he should like to have one of them for his wife; but he never could
find any means of getting at them, as they were very quiet and modest,
and never would enter into conversation with any stranger.</p>
<p>As he now walked along he heard their voices in earnest talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great nonsense of father selling all the celery,
and not letting us have a taste of it!&rdquo; said one, in a
discontented voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is; I don&rsquo;t mean to submit to it either,&rdquo;
said another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you wouldn&rsquo;t disobey father!&rdquo; said the
first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not such a great matter,&rdquo; replied the
other; &ldquo;only a foot of celery<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4470src"
href="#xd21e4470" name="xd21e4470src">77</a>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luxehale was very glad when he heard that, for he had never been
able to catch them in an act of disobedience before. He placed himself
under the celery-bed and watched all the roots. The moment one began to
shake, showing that they were pulling it up, Luxehale took hold of the
root, and held it hard, so that, instead of their pulling it up, he
contrived <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>to drag down the girl who was trying to gather
it.</p>
<p>It was the peasant&rsquo;s eldest daughter Lucia; and much surprised
was she, after passing through the hole Luxehale had made in the earth,
to find herself in the arms of a handsome cavalier, who lavished the
greatest care on her! Lucia had never been spoken to by such a
good-looking gallant before, and felt much pleased with his attention.
She begged him, however, to let her go; but he told her that was
impossible. She was his captive, and he never meant to let her go
again; but if she would only be quiet and reasonable she would be
happier than any queen; that he would take her to a magnificent palace
where she would have every thing she desired, and be as happy as the
day was long, for he would make her his wife. In fact, he succeeded in
dazzling her so with his promises that she began to feel a pleasure in
going with him.</p>
<p>Nor did he break these promises. She was installed into all the
enjoyments of which we have seen the former wife in possession; and as
the Devil admired her beauty, and flattered and fondled her, she did
not altogether regret her captivity. But when the time came that he had
to go upon earth about his business, he brought her all the keys of the
place, with the express recommendation that she was never to attempt to
open the adamant door; then he plucked a red rose, and placed it in her
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>bosom, as a memorial of him, which he promised
should not fade till his return, and departed.</p>
<p>Lucia amused herself very well at first with various occupations and
amusements the palace afforded, and which were new to her; but as the
days fled by she began to grow weary, and at last, from being tired and
out of spirits with her loneliness, she became possessed with so
intense a curiosity to see what lay hid behind the adamant door, that
she could not resist it.</p>
<p>Accordingly she went down at last, with the bunch of keys in her
hand, and with trembling steps made her way up to it. But, without even
trying one of the keys, she found her touch pushed it open, and made
the terrible discovery, that it was the gate of hell! She turned to
escape, and rushed back to her apartment, to weep bitterly over her
forlorn condition.</p>
<p>Two or three days later a train of waggons came laden with beautiful
presents Luxehale had bought and sent home to amuse her, and she became
so interested in turning them all over, that when he returned she was
as bright and smiling as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Luxehale ran to embrace her, but suddenly observed that the rose had
withered on her bosom! When he saw that, he pushed her from him. He had
given it to her as a test to ascertain whether she had gone through the
adamant door, for the heat of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294"
href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>the fire was sure to tarnish
it&mdash;and now he knew she was in possession of his secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have opened the adamant door!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
fiercely; and she, seeing him so fierce, thought it better to deny
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is useless to deny it,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;for
nothing else would have tarnished that rose.&rdquo; And saying that, he
dragged her down to it and thrust her within its enclosure, saying,
&ldquo;You wanted to know what there was behind the adamant door; now
you will know all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Luxehale now had to look out for another wife. He at once bethought
him of Lucia&rsquo;s sisters, and went pacing up and down under their
garden, as before. The two sisters were talking with some warmth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why father should have forbidden us to look
through the trellis!&rdquo; said the voice which had spoken first on
the former occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t mean
to be kept in in that style either,&rdquo; said the other.</p>
<p>Quick as thought the Devil transformed himself into a serpent and
worked his way up through the earth to the other side of the trellis,
where he waited till the maiden put her head through, as she had
threatened. She had no sooner done so than he caught her in his coils
and carried her down under the earth. Before she had time to recover
from her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name=
"pb295">295</a>]</span>surprise, he had transformed himself back into
the handsome cavalier who had charmed Lucia.</p>
<p>It was the second sister, Orsola; and her opposition to his advances
was as easily overcome as Lucia&rsquo;s. She lived in the palace as
Lucia had done, and learnt to feel great delight in its pleasures. At
last the day came when the Devil had to go upon earth about his
business, and he left her with the same charge about the adamant door,
and placed a red rose on her breast, which he promised should not fade
till his return. After a time her weariness induced Orsola to peep
through the fatal door; and the hot blast which escaped as she opened
it would have been sufficient to drive her away, but that it came
charged with the sound of a familiar voice!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucia!&rdquo; she screamed, in a voice thrilled with
horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orsola!&rdquo; returned her unhappy sister, in a tone of
agony.</p>
<p>Orsola knew enough. She did not dare venture farther; and as she
made her way back to her apartment she saw in the court below the
retinue which had escorted her husband back. Assuming as composed a
mien as possible, she went out to meet him, and he ran towards her with
every appearance of affection&mdash;but his eye caught the withered
rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have opened the adamant door,&rdquo; he said, sternly.
&ldquo;There is no help for you; those who once pass it cannot live up
above here any more. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296"
name="pb296">296</a>]</span>You must go back, and live there for
ever!&rdquo; And, regardless of her entreaties and cries, he dragged
her down, and thrust her into the burning pit.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Luxehale now had to search for another wife, and he determined it
should be no other than the third of the sisters. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he
reflected, as he walked towards her cottage, &ldquo;now she has no one
left to talk to, how shall I manage? Ah, well, I generally find a way
to do most things I take in hand&mdash;and if I don&rsquo;t catch her I
needn&rsquo;t break my heart; there are plenty of girls in the world
whom I have arts to enthrall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he did hear her voice. As he got near she was singing, very
sadly and sweetly, a verse which told her regrets for her sisters, and
called on them to return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; said Luxehale, &ldquo;she is
sure to come to the spot where she last saw her sister. I&rsquo;ll be
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, transforming himself once more into a serpent, he wriggled
through the earth and took up his place of observation beside the
trellis. He had not been there long, when she actually came up to it,
singing the same melancholy strains; and then she stopped to call,
&ldquo;Lucia! Orsola! Lucia! Orsola!&rdquo; till the woods rang again.
Then she seemed to get weary with calling, and she leant against the
trellis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! she&rsquo;ll soon put her head through now,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>chuckled Luxehale. And so she did, sure enough;
and no sooner did her head appear on the other side than he twisted his
coils round her and dragged her down under the earth.</p>
<p>Before she recovered herself he once more appeared as a handsome
cavalier.</p>
<p>It was Regina, the youngest and best-conducted of the sisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go! let me go!&rdquo; she cried, refusing to look at
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard you calling for your sisters,&rdquo; he
replied, soothingly; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you want to see
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! tell me where they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you where they are,&rdquo; he answered;
&ldquo;and if I did, it would be of no use, because you would not know
the way to where they are. But if you come with me, it is possible we
may be able to hear something about them some day. One thing is
certain, no one else is so likely to be able to hear of them as
I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regina was terribly perplexed, something within her said she ought
not to speak to the stranger gallant. &ldquo;And yet, on the other
hand, if, by going with him, I can do any thing to recover my dear
sisters,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;I ought to risk something for
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he saw her hesitate, he knew his affair was won; and, indeed,
it required little persuasion to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298"
href="#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span>decide her now. As they went
along he said so many soft and flattering things as to make her forget
insensibly about her sisters. But when they got to the palace there
were such a number of beautiful things to occupy her attention, so much
to astonish her&mdash;a poor peasant maid who had never seen any of
these fine things before&mdash;that she soon got habituated to her new
life, and the fact of her having come for her sisters&rsquo; sake went
quite out of her remembrance.</p>
<p>Luxehale was delighted to have brought things so far; and in
proportion to the difficulty he had had in winning her, was the
satisfaction he felt in being with her; thus he spent a longer time
with her than he had with either of the other sisters. But the time
came at last when he had to go upon earth about his business; and then
he gave her the same charge as the others about the keys and the
adamant door, and the rose which was not to fade till his return.</p>
<p>It was not many days either before the desire to see what was hid
behind it took possession of her; but as she approached it she already
perceived that the air that came from it was dry and heated, and as she
really regarded the rose as a token of affection, she was concerned to
keep it fair and fresh, so she went back and placed it in a glass of
water, and then pursued her investigation of the secret of the adamant
door. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name=
"pb299">299</a>]</span></p>
<p>She had learnt enough when she had but half opened it, and smelt the
stifling fumes of sulphur which issued from the pit it guarded, and
would have turned to go, but then her sisters&rsquo; voices, wailing in
piteous accents, met her ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucia! Orsola!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regina!&rdquo; they replied; and then, courageously advancing
farther by the light of the lurid flames, which burnt fitfully through
the smoke, now red with a horrid glare, now ashy grey and ghastly, she
descried the beloved forms of her sisters writhing and wailing, and
calling on her to help them.</p>
<p>She promised to use all her best endeavours to release them, and, in
the meantime, bid them keep up their courage as best they might, and be
on the look-out to take advantage of the first chance of escape she
could throw in their way. With that she returned to her apartment,
replaced the rose in her bosom, and looked out for the return of
Luxehale. Nor did he keep her long waiting; and when he saw the rose
blooming as freshly as at the first he was delighted, and embraced her
with enthusiasm. In fact, he was so smiling and well inclined that she
thought she could not do better than take advantage of his good humour
to carry out the plan she had already conceived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the
way in which your people wash my things; they dry them in a hot room.
Now I&rsquo;ve always been accustomed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb300" href="#pb300" name="pb300">300</a>]</span>to dry them on the
grass, where the thyme grows, and then they not only get beautifully
aired, but they retain a sweet scent of the wild thyme which I have
always loved since the days when I was a little, little girl, and my
mother used to kiss me when she put on my clean things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be done as you like,&rdquo; said Luxehale. &ldquo;I
will order a field of thyme to be got ready immediately, and your
things shall always be dried upon it. Is there nothing else, nothing
more difficult, I can do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, do you know,&rdquo; she replied&mdash;for this would
not have answered her purpose at all&mdash;&ldquo;do you know, I
don&rsquo;t fancy that would be quite the same thing either; there is
something peculiar about the scent of our grass and our thyme at home
which is very dear to me. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be possible to send the
things home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luxehale looked undecided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the <i>only</i> thing wanted to make this
beautiful place perfectly delightful,&rdquo; she continued.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t resist this, and promised she should do as she
liked.</p>
<p>Regina then ordered a large box to be made, and packed a quantity of
her things into it. But in the night when all slept she went down to
the adamant door, and called Lucia.</p>
<p>Both sisters came running out. &ldquo;One at a time!&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Lucia has been in longest; it will be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>your
turn next.&rdquo; So she took Lucia up with her, and hid her in the box
under the clothes, and told her what she had to do. She was to send all
the linen back clean at the end of the week, and well scent it with
thyme, and to fill up the vacant space with more linen, so that it
might not seem to return with less in it than when it went. She told
her also, if the porter who carried the box should take into his head
to peep in, &ldquo;all you have to say is, &lsquo;I see you!&rsquo; and
you will find that will cure him.&rdquo; Then she went to bed, and
slept quietly till morning.</p>
<p>Early next day Luxehale called a porter to carry the box, to whom
she overheard him giving secret instructions that, as soon as he had
got to a good distance, he should search the box, and let him know what
was in it before he sent him up to her for final orders.</p>
<p>Regina told him all about the situation of her father&rsquo;s
cottage. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had my eye on
you a long time&mdash;you&rsquo;re not a bad sort of fellow, but
you&rsquo;re too curious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve never been where your worship <i>could</i>
see me!&rdquo; answered the porter; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always worked in
the stables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see <i>every where</i>!&rdquo; replied Regina,
solemnly. &ldquo;I can see you in the stables as well as I can see you
here, and as well as I shall be able to see you all the way you are
journeying; and if an impertinent curiosity should take you to look at
my clothes, I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name=
"pb302">302</a>]</span>shall see you, you may be sure, and shall have
you properly punished, so beware!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The porter planted the chest on his strong shoulders and walked
away. He was a devil-may-care sort of fellow, and didn&rsquo;t
altogether believe in Regina&rsquo;s power of seeing &ldquo;<i>every
where</i>,&rdquo; and, as his master&rsquo;s injunction to look into
the box accorded much better with his own humour than Regina&rsquo;s
order to abstain from opening it, before he had got halfway he set it
down on the ground, and opened it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you!&rdquo; said Lucia, from within; and her voice was
so like her sister&rsquo;s that the fellow made no doubt it was Regina
herself who really saw him as she had threatened; and, clapping the box
to again in a great fright, lifted it on to his shoulders with all
expedition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought your daughter&rsquo;s linen to be
washed!&rdquo; cried the porter, when he arrived at the cottage, to the
father of the Devil&rsquo;s wives, who was in his field
&ldquo;breaking&rdquo; Indian corn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a message to
carry about a hundred miles farther and shall be back by the end of the
week, so please have it all ready for me to take back when I call for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good peasant gave him a glass of his best
K&uuml;chelberger<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4620src" href="#xd21e4620"
name="xd21e4620src">78</a>, and sent him on his way rejoicing.</p>
<p>He had no sooner departed than Lucia started up out of the box of
linen, and hastily told her father all the story. The peasant&rsquo;s
hair stood on end as he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href=
"#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span>listened, but they felt there was
no time to be lost. All the linen Regina had sent, and all that
remained in the cottage, was washed and well scented with thyme, and
packed smoothly into the box for the porter to take back with him. They
had hardly got it all ready when he came to the gate to ask for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are!&rdquo; said the peasant; and the porter lifted
the box on to his strong shoulders, and made the best of his way
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you find when you looked into the box?&rdquo; asked
the Devil, the first time he could catch the porter alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! nothing whatever but dirty linen,&rdquo; replied he, too
much of a braggadocio to confess that he had been scared by a
woman&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>After receiving this testimony the Devil made no sort of obstacle
any more to his wife sending a box home whenever she would, and as soon
as she collected sufficient to justify the use of the large chest she
ordered the porter to be ready over night, and then went down and
called Orsola.</p>
<p>Orsola came quickly enough, and was packed into the linen chest as
her sister had been, and with the same instructions. &ldquo;Only, as I
don&rsquo;t mean to stay here much longer behind, there is no reason
why we should lose all our best linen, so don&rsquo;t send a great deal
back this time, but fill up the box with celery, of which Luxehale is
very fond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The porter, feeling somewhat ashamed of his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>pusillanimity on the last occasion, determined
this time to have a good look into the box, for the effect of his
fright had worn off, and he said to himself, &ldquo;It was only a
foolish fancy&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t really have heard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he had hardly got half way when he set the box down, and lifted
the lid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you!&rdquo; exclaimed Orsola, in a voice so like
Regina&rsquo;s that the lid slipped out of his hand, and fell upon the
box with a crash which startled Orsola herself. He loaded the box on
his shoulders once more, nor stopped again till he reached his
destination.</p>
<p>Hearty was the greeting of the two sisters and their father as soon
as he was gone; and then they set to work to get the washing done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The weather has been so bad,&rdquo; said the father, when the
porter returned, &ldquo;that we could not dry all the linen, please to
say to your mistress, but we hope to have it ready to go back with next
week&rsquo;s; beg her acceptance, however, of the celery which I have
packed into the box in its place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you look into the box this time?&rdquo; said Luxehale, as
soon as he got the porter alone.</p>
<p>The porter did not like to acknowledge that he had been scared by a
woman, and so declared again that there was nothing in the box but
linen.</p>
<p>It was more difficult to arrange for her own escape, but Regina had
a plan for all. The box <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href=
"#pb305" name="pb305">305</a>]</span>had now gone backwards and
forwards often enough for the porter to need no fresh directions, so
she told him over-night where he would find it in the morning; and he,
finding it seem all as usual, loaded it on his shoulders, and walked
off with it by the usual path.</p>
<p>He had not performed half the journey when he determined to have a
serious look into the box this time, and be scared by no one.
Accordingly he lifted the lid, but this time the words,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you!&rdquo; came out of the box so unmistakably in
Regina&rsquo;s voice, that there was no room for doubt of her power of
seeing him, and with more haste than ever he closed it up again, and
made the best of his way to the peasant&rsquo;s cottage.</p>
<p>Both sisters and their father greeted Regina as their good angel and
deliverer when she stepped out of the box; and they went on talking
over all their adventures with no need to make haste, for Regina had
brought away with her money and jewels enough to make them rich for the
rest of their lives, so that they had no need to work any more at
all.</p>
<p>When the porter returned to ask for the linen-chest, the peasant
came out with a humorous smile, and bid him tell his master that they
had not time to do the washing that week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what shall I tell my mistress?&rdquo; asked the man.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span></p>
<p>As he said so, Regina and her sisters came into the room, striking
him dumb with astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you had better not go back to him,&rdquo; she said,
compassionating him for the treatment that would have awaited him, had
he returned without her; &ldquo;Luxehale would doubtless vent his fury
on you for my absence. Better to stay here and serve us; and you need
not fear his power as long as you keep out of his territory.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>After this, Luxehale determined to give up young and pretty wives,
since they proved sharp enough to outwit him, as he had before given up
rich and titled ones, who were like to have knights and princes to
deliver them.</p>
<p>This time he said he would look out for a bustling woman of good
common sense, who had been knocked about in the world long enough to
know the value of what he had to offer her.</p>
<p>So he went out into the town of Trient, and fixed upon a buxom woman
of the middle class, who was just in her first mourning for her
husband, and mourned him not because she cared for him, for he had been
a bad man, and constantly quarrelled with her, but because, now he was
dead, she had no one to provide for her, and after a life of
comparative comfort, she saw penury and starvation staring her in the
face.</p>
<p>He met her walking in the olive-yard upon the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>hill
whence her husband&rsquo;s chief means had been derived. &ldquo;And to
think that all these fine trees, our fruitful <i lang="it">arativo</i>,
and our bright green <i>prativo</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e4692src"
href="#xd21e4692" name="xd21e4692src">79</a>, are to be sold to pay
those rascally creditors of my brute of a husband!&rdquo; she mused as
she sat upon the rising ground, and cried. &ldquo;If he had nothing to
leave me, why did he go off in that cowardly way, and leave me here?
what is the use of living, if one has nothing to live upon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Devil overheard her, and perceived she was just in the mood for
his purpose, but took care to appear to have heard nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you still charitably mourning because the Devil has
taken your tyrant of a husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not because he has taken him, but because he didn&rsquo;t
take me too, at the same time!&rdquo; answered the woman,
pettishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! did you love the old churl as much as all that?&rdquo;
asked Luxehale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love him! what put <i>that</i> into your head? But I
didn&rsquo;t want to be left here to starve, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along with me then, and you shan&rsquo;t starve. You
shall have a jollier time of it than with the old fool who is
dead&mdash;plenty to eat and drink, and no lack, and no
work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a bad proposition, certainly; but, pray, who
are you?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308"
name="pb308">308</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am he who you regretted just now had not taken you. I
<i>will</i> take you, if you wish, and make you my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> the Devil!&rdquo; exclaimed the woman, eyeing the
handsome person he had assumed from head to foot; &ldquo;impossible,
you can&rsquo;t be the Devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see the Devil&rsquo;s not so black as he&rsquo;s
painted,&rdquo; replied Luxehale. &ldquo;Believe me that is all stuff,
invented by designing knaves to deceive silly people. You can see for
yourself if I don&rsquo;t look, by a long way, handsomer and taller
than your departed spouse, at all events.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no saying nay to <i>that</i>,&rdquo; responded
the widow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor to my other proposition either,&rdquo; urged Luxehale;
and, as he found she ceased to make any resistance, he took her up in
his arms, and, spreading his great bat&rsquo;s wings, carried her down
to his palace, where he installed her as lady and mistress, much to her
own satisfaction.</p>
<p>As she was fond of luxury and ease, and had met with little of it
before, the life in the Devil&rsquo;s palace suited her uncommonly
well, and yet, though she had every thing her own way, her bad temper
frequently found subject for quarrel and complaint.</p>
<p>It was on one occasion when her temper had thus been ruffled, and
she had had an angry dispute with Luxehale, who to avoid her wrangling
had gone <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span>off in a sullen mood to bed, that some one
knocked at the door. All the servants were gone to bed, so she got up,
and asked who was there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, Pangrazio Clamer of Trient,&rdquo; said a somewhat
tremulous voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pangrazio Clamer of Trient!&rdquo; returned the widow;
&ldquo;come in, and welcome. But how did you get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a longish story; but, first, how did <i>you</i>
get here, and installed here too, it seems? Ah, Giuseppa, you had
better have married me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve forbidden you to talk of that,&rdquo; answered
Giuseppa. &ldquo;Besides, I had not better have married you, for I have
married a great prince, who is able to keep me in every kind of luxury,
and give me every thing I can wish. You couldn&rsquo;t have done
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; he sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk any more about that. Tell
me how every one is going on in Trient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By-and-by, if there is time. But, first, let me tell you
about myself, and what brought me here. That&rsquo;s strange
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what was it, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that you refused to have me, because I was
poor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have already forbidden you to allude to that
subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must know, then, that though I worked so hard to try and
make myself rich enough to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href=
"#pb310" name="pb310">310</a>]</span>please you, I only got poorer and
poorer; while at the same time, there was Eligio Righi, who, though his
father left him a good fortune to begin with, kept on getting richer
and richer, till he had bought up all the mines and all the
olive-grounds, and all the vineyards and mulberry-trees that were to be
sold for miles round&mdash;yours among the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and I often felt tempted to envy him, but I never did.
One day he came to me while I was hard at work, and said, &lsquo;You
know, Pangrazio Clamer, that I am very rich;&rsquo; and I thought he
didn&rsquo;t need to have come and said that to me, who had all the
labour in life to keep off envying him, as it was.
&lsquo;Pangrazio,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;I am not only rich, but I have
every thing I can wish, but one thing; and if I meet any one who will
do that one thing, I will take him to share my riches while I live, and
make him my heir at my death. I come first to ask you.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Tell me what it is,&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t work
harder, or fare worse, than I do now, whatever it may be&mdash;so
I&rsquo;m your man.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, then, it&rsquo;s this,&rsquo;
he continued. &lsquo;My one great unfulfilled wish through life has
been to give the Devil three good kicks, as some punishment for all the
mischief he does in the world; but I have never had the courage to make
the attempt, and now I have got old, and past the strength for
adventures, so if <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311"
name="pb311">311</a>]</span>you will do this in my stead, I will put
you in my shoes as far as my money is concerned.&rsquo; Of course, I
answered I would set out directly; and, as he had made the road by
which men get hither his study, for this very purpose, all through his
life, he could give me very exact directions for finding the
Devil&rsquo;s abode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, to get here, I had to traverse the lands of three
different sovereigns; and, as I had to go to them to get my passport
properly in order, they learned my destination, and each gave me a
commission on his own account, which I accepted, because if I should
fail with Eligio Righi&rsquo;s affair, I should have a chance of the
rewards they promised me to fall back on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what were these three commissions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first king wants to know why the fountain which supplied
all his country with such beautiful bright water has suddenly ceased to
flow. The second king wants a remedy for the malady of his only son,
who lies at the point of death, and no physician knows what ails him.
And the third king wants to know why all the trees in his dominions
bear such splendid foliage, but bring forth no fruit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you expect me to help you in all this?&rdquo; said the
Devil&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for our old acquaintance&rsquo; sake, and the bond of
our common home,&rdquo; said Clamer, &ldquo;you <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>might do that; and for the sake of the nearer
bond that <i>might</i> have united us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have refused you all you ask, to punish you for going
back to that story,&rdquo; said Giuseppa, &ldquo;but I really desire to
see old Luxehale get a good drubbing, just now, for he has been very
tiresome to-day. I daren&rsquo;t give it him myself, but I&rsquo;ll
help you to do it, if you have a mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the motive, provided you give me the help,&rdquo;
replied Clamer. &ldquo;And will you help me to trick him out of the
answers for the three kings, as well as to give him a good
drubbing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will I; for it will be good fun to counter-act some of
his mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How shall we set about it then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am just going to bed; he is asleep already. You must
conceal yourself in the curtains, and bring a big stick with you; and
when I make a sign, you must, without a moment&rsquo;s notice, set to
and give it him. Will that do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Admirably! Only, remember, I have to do it three times, or I
shan&rsquo;t get my guerdon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you think you are certain of getting all Eligio
Righi&rsquo;s fortune?&rdquo; said Giuseppa, earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, as sure as fate!&rdquo; replied Clamer; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
a man who never goes back from his word. But I must fulfil all he says
with equal exactness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when I&rsquo;ve helped you with half your <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name=
"pb313">313</a>]</span>labour, I don&rsquo;t see why I shouldn&rsquo;t
have half your guerdon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I! You&rsquo;ll always find me faithful and true; and
what I offered you when I was poor, I offer you with equal heartiness
when I have the prospect of being the richest man in Trient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you have done all you have to do, then, will you take me
back with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing would make me happier than your consent to come with
me. And when I&rsquo;m rich enough to be well fed and clothed,
you&rsquo;ll find I&rsquo;m not such a bad-looking fellow, after
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;ll never be so handsome as Luxehale! But then I
don&rsquo;t half trust him. One never knows what trick he may take into
his head to play one. I think I should have more confidence of being
able to manage you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s agreed; you come back with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I believe it&rsquo;s the best thing, after all. And now
we must make haste and set about our business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She crept up-stairs with soft steps, and Clamer still more softly
after her. The Devil was sleeping soundly, and snoring like the roar of
a wild beast. Giuseppa stowed Clamer away in the curtains, and went to
bed too. When she heard what she reckoned one of the soundest snores,
she lifted the bed-curtains, and whispered, &ldquo;Now&rsquo;s your
time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clamer did not wait to be told twice, but raised <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span>his
stick, and, as Giuseppa lifted the bed-clothes, applied it in the right
place, with a hearty good will.</p>
<p>Luxehale woke with a roar of pain, and Clamer disappeared behind the
curtains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, dear lord!&rdquo; said Giuseppa; &ldquo;I had
such a strange dream, that it woke me all of a start, and I suppose
made me knock you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you dream about?&rdquo; said Luxehale, thinking to
catch her at fault; but Giuseppa had her answer ready.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I was travelling through a country where all the
people were panting for want of water, and as I passed along, they all
gathered round me, and desired me to tell them, what had stopped their
water from flowing, saying, &lsquo;You are the Devil&rsquo;s wife, so
you must know!&rsquo; and when I couldn&rsquo;t tell them, they threw
stones at me, so that I seemed to have a hard matter to escape from
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Devil burst out into a loud laugh, which absorbed all his
ill-humour, as he heard this story, and Giuseppa made a sign to Clamer
to pay attention to what was to follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, you never tell me any thing,&rdquo; she continued,
pretending to cry; &ldquo;I never know any thing about your business,
and, you see, all those people expected I knew every thing my husband
knew, as other wives do.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315"
href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d care to know any thing
about it,&rdquo; replied Luxehale, trying to soothe her; &ldquo;and
really there was nothing to tell! It&rsquo;s an every-day matter. There
was a pilgrimage chapel near the city, to which the people used to go
in procession every year; and as long as they did that, I never could
get past to get at the fountains. But now they have left off the
procession, and so I got by, and had the fun of stopping the
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clamer winked to Giuseppa, to show he understood what the remedy
was, and Giuseppa said no more, so that the Devil very soon fell off to
sleep again.</p>
<p>When he began to snore again very soundly, she lifted the
bed-clothes, and made the agreed sign to Clamer. Clamer came forward,
and applied his stick with a hearty will in the right place, and the
Devil woke with a shout of fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear husband!&rdquo; cried Giuseppa, deprecating his
wrath by her tone of alarm; &ldquo;I have had another dreadful
dream!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; growled the Devil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I was going through a great city where all the
people were in sorrow, and sat with ashes on their heads. And when they
saw me pass, they said they sat so because the king&rsquo;s son was at
the point of death, and no one could tell what ailed him, and all the
doctors were of no use; but that as I was the Devil&rsquo;s wife, I
must know all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316" name=
"pb316">316</a>]</span>about it. When I couldn&rsquo;t tell them, they
began pelting me; as they kept putting fresh ashes on their heads each
had a pan of fire by his side, in which they were making, and they
actually took the red-hot cinders out of the pan of fire to pelt me
with, and my clothes were all on fire; so you may believe if I tried to
run away fast&mdash;and it is no wonder if I knocked you a
little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Devil&rsquo;s fancy was more tickled than before with this
story, and he laughed fit to split his sides, as she proceeded, so that
he forgot all about the beating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all very well for you to lie there and laugh, but you
wouldn&rsquo;t have laughed if you had been treated as I was, I can
tell you!&rdquo; sobbed Giuseppa. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s all because you
never tell me any thing, as other husbands do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; answered the Devil; &ldquo;I should have enough
to do, if I told you all the stories like that! Why, it&rsquo;s the
commonest thing in the world. That king&rsquo;s son was a good young
man, obedient to all the advice of his elders. But after a time he got
with bad companions, who introduced him to some of my people. After
they had played him a number of tricks, one day one of them took into
his head to give him a stunning good illness, to punish him for some
luck he had had against them at cards. And that&rsquo;s the history of
that&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing commoner in life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giuseppa made a sign to know if Clamer had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317" name=
"pb317">317</a>]</span>heard all he wanted to know, and, finding he was
satisfied, let the Devil go to sleep again.</p>
<p>As soon as he began to snore very soundly, Giuseppa lifted the
bed-clothes, and Clamer once more applied his stick. Whether by getting
used to the work and therefore less nervous, he really hit him harder,
or whether the previous blows had made the Devil more sensitive, he
certainly woke this time in a more furious passion than ever, and with
so rapid a start that it was all Clamer could do to get out of his
sight in time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you been dreaming now?&rdquo; he exclaimed, in his
most fearful voice. &ldquo;I declare, I can scarcely keep my hands off
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry,&rdquo; answered Giuseppa; &ldquo;it is
I who have had the worst of it. I dreamt I was passing through a
country where the trees had given up bearing fruit; and when the people
saw me go by, they all came round me, and said, as I was the
Devil&rsquo;s wife, I must know what ailed their trees; and when I
couldn&rsquo;t tell them, they cut down great branches, and ran after
me, poking the sharp, rough points into my sides! You may believe if I
tried to run away fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Devil had never had such a laugh since he had been a devil, as
at this story, and the whole palace echoed with his merriment.</p>
<p>When Giuseppa found him once more in such good humour, she went
on,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why do you do such mischievous things, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name="pb318">318</a>]</span>and
make people so savage? It isn&rsquo;t fair that they don&rsquo;t dare
to touch you and all their ill-will falls on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it happens, it&rsquo;s not my doing at all this time; at
least, I didn&rsquo;t go out of my way to do it for any sort of fun. It
all came about in the regular way of business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; pursued Giuseppa, who knew it was
necessary to probe the matter to the bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the king of that country is a regular miser. He is so
afraid that any body should get any thing out of their gardens without
paying the due tribute to him first, that he has built such high walls
round all the orchards, and vine-gardens, and olive-yards, that no sun
can get at them. And he is so stingy, he won&rsquo;t pay people to dig
round them and manure, and prune, and attend to the property; so how
can the fruit grow? As long as he defrauds the poor people of their
work, he can have no fruit. It&rsquo;s not my fault at all!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, really, I&rsquo;ve had enough of this. You&rsquo;d
better go and sleep somewhere else for the rest of the night, for I
can&rsquo;t stand being woke up any more. If you do it again, I am sure
I shall strangle you&mdash;and that would be a pity! Go along, and
dream somewhere else&mdash;and I hope you may get properly punished
before you wake next time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giuseppa desired no command so much; but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>pretending to cry and be much offended, she got
up and went to lie down in another bed till the Devil began to snore
soundly again. Then she rose up, and, taking all her fine clothes and
jewels, went out softly, and beckoned to Clamer to follow her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose the Devil wakes before we get far away?&rdquo; said
Clamer, beginning to get frightened as the time of trial
approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear!&rdquo; answered Giuseppa; &ldquo;when he gets
disturbed like that, he sleeps for a week after it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she clapped her hands, and a number of great birds came
flapping round. She helped Clamer on to the back of one, and, loading
her jewels on to another, sprang on to a third, and away they flew,
while she beckoned to three more to follow behind.</p>
<p>When they came to the first kingdom, Clamer left the strange
<i>cort&eacute;ge</i> behind a mountain, and went alone up to the
court, to tell the king he was a miser, and that if he gave up his
sordid ways and set the people, who were starving for want of work, to
pull down half the height of his walls, and to dig, manure, and prune
his trees, he would have as good a crop of fruit as any in the world.
Then the king acknowledged his fault, and praised Clamer for pointing
it out, and gave him a great bag of gold as his reward.</p>
<p>Clamer packed the sack of gold on to the back <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>of
one of the birds which were following them, and away they sped again.
When they arrived at the second kingdom, Clamer hid his
<i>cort&eacute;ge</i> in a pine forest, and went alone to the court, to
tell the king that if his son would give up his bad companions, and
live according to the advice of his elders, he would be all well again
as before. The prince was very much astonished to find that Clamer knew
about his bad behaviour, for he had concealed it from his parents and
all about him, but this convinced him that he must be right in what he
said, so he promised to alter his life and behave according to the wise
counsel of his elders in future. From that moment he began to get
better; and the king, in joy at his restoration, gave Clamer a great
sack of gold, which he laded on to the back of the second bird; and
away they flew again.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the third kingdom, Clamer hid his retinue in
the bed of a dried lake and went alone to the court, to tell the king
that if he would order the procession to the pilgrimage chapel to be
resumed, the Devil would not be able to get in to stop the fountains.
The king at once ordered the grandest procession that had ever been
known in the memory of the oldest inhabitant, and all the people went
out devoutly praying. Immediately the springs and fountains began to
flow again; and the king was so pleased that he gave Clamer a great
sack of gold, which he packed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321"
href="#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>on to the back of the third
bird; and away they flew again, till they reached the gloomy shades of
the Val d&rsquo;Ombretta, under the cold, steep precipices of the
Marmolata<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4921src" href="#xd21e4921" name=
"xd21e4921src">80</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here will be a good place to hide all this treasure,&rdquo;
said Giuseppa; &ldquo;it will never do to take it into Trient all at
once. We will bury it here where foot of man seldom falls, and my birds
will keep good watch over it and defend it, and yet by their services
we shall be able to fetch down any portion of it as we want
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clamer saw there was some good in the proposal, but he hardly liked
giving up the possession of the treasure to Giuseppa&rsquo;s birds,
neither did he like to show any want of confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it an excellent plan?&rdquo; asked
Giuseppa, as she saw him hesitate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could stow it away as safely in an old well at
home,&rdquo; said Clamer. &ldquo;This is an uncanny place of evil
renown, and I had just as lief have nothing to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the place?&rdquo; asked
Giuseppa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know, the Marmolata was as fertile as any pasture of
Tirol once,&rdquo; answered Clamer; &ldquo;and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span>because the people had such fine returns for
their labour from it, they grew careless and impious, and were not
satisfied with all the week for working in it, but must needs be at it
on Sundays and holidays as well. One Sunday an ancient man came by and
chid them for their profanity. &lsquo;Go along with your old
wives&rsquo; stories!&rsquo; said a rich proprietor who was directing
the labourers; &lsquo;Sunday and working-day is all alike to us. We
have sun and rain and a fine soil, what do we want with going to church
to pray?&rsquo; And they sang,&mdash;</p>
<div lang="it" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&rsquo;Nos ongh el fengh en te tabl&agrave;,</p>
<p class="line">E i autri sul pr&agrave;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4944src" href="#xd21e4944" name="xd21e4944src">81</a>!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The old man lifted up his finger in warning,
and passed on his way; but as he went it came on to snow. And it snowed
on till it had covered all the ground; covered all the hay up to the
top; covered over the heads of the labourers and their masters; snowed
so deep that the sun has never been able to melt it away again! A curse
is on the place, and I had rather have nothing to do with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve lived long enough where curses abound to care
very little about them,&rdquo; answered Giuseppa, &ldquo;or I could
tell you the real story about that, for you&rsquo;ve only got the wrong
end of it. But it doesn&rsquo;t do to think of those things. The only
way is to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name=
"pb323">323</a>]</span>laugh at all that sort of thing, and make
yourself jolly while you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My story&rsquo;s the right one,&rdquo; replied Clamer,
&ldquo;and you won&rsquo;t laugh me out of believing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear no; the right story is much more serious than that!
But I lose my patience with people who trouble themselves about those
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s any more of the
story,&rdquo; continued Clamer, who was dying to hear it, and knew that
the best way to get at it was by provoking her. Had he merely begged
her to tell it, she would have found a perverse pleasure in
disappointing him.</p>
<p>Giuseppa was very easily provoked. &ldquo;The right story proves
itself,&rdquo; she cried, pettishly; and Clamer chuckled aside to see
his plan succeed. &ldquo;Your way of telling it only accounts for the
snow; how do you account for the ice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s no way of accounting for
<i>that</i>,&rdquo; replied Clamer, with a malicious laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is,&rdquo; rejoined Giuseppa, fairly caught.
&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t an old man at all who came to give the warning.
It was a very young man, for it was no one else but St.
John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;St. John!&rdquo; cried Clamer; &ldquo;how could that
be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know any thing, then?&rdquo; retorted
Giuseppa. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that there was a time when our
Lord and His Apostles went walking over the earth, preaching the
Gospel?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=
"pb324">324</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course I know <i>that</i>,&rdquo; replied Clamer,
much offended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, in process of travelling they came here just the
same as every where else&mdash;why shouldn&rsquo;t they? The Apostles
had been sent on to prepare a lodging for the night, and St. John,
being the youngest and best walker, outstripped the rest, and came by
first. But he was so soft and gentle in his warning that the labourers
laughed at him, and he went on his way sighing, for he saw that their
hearts were hardened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then St. Peter and St. Paul came by&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But St. Paul&mdash;&rdquo; interposed Clamer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt, but listen,&rdquo; said Giuseppa.
&ldquo;St. Peter and St. Paul, though not younger than the others like
St. John, were always in the front in all matters, because of their
eagerness and zeal, and the important post which was assigned them in
the Church. They came next, therefore; but they, seeing the men working
on Sunday, were filled with indignation, and chid them so fiercely that
they only made them angry, and they took up stones to throw at them,
and drove them out of the ground. One by one the other Apostles all
came by and warned them, but none of them seemed to have the right way
of getting at their hearts. And they went on working, with a worse sin
on them for having been warned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last of all, the Lord Himself came by, and His <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=
"pb325">325</a>]</span>heart was moved with compassion by the
perversity of the people. He saw that all the preaching of all His
Apostles had been in vain, and He resolved to save them in another way,
and prove them, to see if there was any charity or any good in them at
all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of threatening and warning, He came leaning on His
staff, weary and way-sore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You have a fine Berg-Segen<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4995src" href="#xd21e4995" name="xd21e4995src">82</a>, my
friends,&rsquo; He said, sweetly, as He sat on a great heap of fresh
hay placed ready to load the returning wain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, yes! first-rate crops,&rsquo; replied the rich
proprietor, with a look of contempt at the travel-stained garments of
the wayfarer; &lsquo;but they&rsquo;re not meant to serve as beds for
idle fellows who go prowling about the country and live by begging
instead of by work, so you just get up and take yourself
off!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Lord looked at him with a piteous glance, but his heart
was not softened. &lsquo;Move off quicker than that, or you&rsquo;ll
taste my stick!&rsquo; he cried, assuming a threatening attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Lord passed on, without uttering a word of complaint,
till He reached the holding of the next proprietor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where there are such fine pastures there must be fine
cattle and a fine store of produce,&rsquo; He said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;ve plenty of stores!&rsquo; said the
man addressed; &lsquo;and that&rsquo;s just why I don&rsquo;t like to
have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name=
"pb326">326</a>]</span>loafing vagabonds about my place; so please to
move on quicker than you came.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But I&rsquo;m weary, my good man, and have come a long
journey this day, and have nothing to eat: give me, now, but one sup of
milk from your bountiful provision there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Give!&rsquo; answered the man; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
nothing to give away. I work hard for all I gain, and I don&rsquo;t
encourage those who don&rsquo;t work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But you won&rsquo;t miss the little I ask&mdash;and I
have travelled very far and am very weary,&rsquo; replied our Lord,
condescending to speak very piteously, to see if He could not by any
means move the man&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hola! you there! Domenico, Virgilio, Giacomo, Rocco,
Pero! come along here, and throw this fellow out!&rsquo; shouted the
proprietor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men turned with their pitchforks, and drove the wayfarer
rudely away, without pity, notwithstanding that His legs trembled with
weariness and the way was so steep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Lord uttered not a word, and hasted on, that He might not
increase their condemnation by resistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the heavens grew black with anger at the sight; the
storm-clouds gathered in vengeance; grey and leaden, mass above mass,
they thickened over the devoted peak of the Marmolata; the sun ceased
to smile, and a horrible darkness fell around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Closer and closer lowered the clouds, till they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327" name=
"pb327">327</a>]</span>fell, enveloping the mountain-top with white
fields of snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nay!&rsquo; cried the Saviour, compassionately;
&lsquo;Father, stay Thine hand!&rsquo; And for a moment the convulsion
of the angry element was stilled. &lsquo;They knew not what they
did,&rsquo; He pleaded; and He passed down the path to the next
holding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;See,&rsquo; He said to the proprietor, who was
watching the strange storm with some alarm, &lsquo;see how terrible are
the judgments of God! Give Him praise for the blessing He has poured
out on you, and save yourself from His anger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What have I to do with the misfortunes of others?
Every thing goes right with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But it may not always. Be wise betimes, and render
praise to God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do I know about God?&rsquo; answered the man;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve enough to do with taking care of the earth; I
don&rsquo;t want to puzzle my head about heaven!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All good gifts are from heaven.&rsquo; replied the
Lord, faintly; and He sank upon the ground exhausted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;See!&rsquo; cried a woman who had come out with her
husband&rsquo;s dinner, &lsquo;see, He has fallen; will you do nothing
to restore Him?&rsquo; And she ran to raise Him up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let Him lie.&rsquo; said her master, pushing her
roughly away; &lsquo;it were better the earth were rid of such idle
fellows.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had filled up the measure of his iniquity. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>&rsquo;Hard and icy as his heart has been, so
shall his pasture be!&rsquo; proclaimed the Angel of Judgment. And as
he spread his arms abroad, the clouds fell over the sides of the
mountain; the cold blast turned them into ice, and it became a barren
glacier for evermore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the angels carried the Lord to the place the Apostles had
prepared for Him. And the woman who had pitied Him alone escaped and
recorded the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shudder had fallen over Clamer, and he seemed hardly inclined to
break the silence which reigned around. There was not a bird to chirp a
note, nor a leaf to flutter, nor a blade of grass to gladden the eye.
Meantime they had reached the Fassathal, which, though so fruitful
farther along, is scarcely more smiling at its east end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were it not well, Pangrazio,&rdquo; urged Giuseppa, &ldquo;to
bury our treasure <i>here</i>, before we get nearer the habitations of
men? Ah!&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I see what it is, it is not of the
weird neighbourhood that you are shy, it is that you trust not me! you
think if my birds guard the treasure you will have less control over it
than I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; answered Clamer, ashamed to have been found
out; &ldquo;it is not that; but there are as many weird warnings rife
here as concerning the Marmolata. Does not the <span lang="de">Feuriger
Verr&auml;ther</span><a class="noteref" id="xd21e5064src" href=
"#xd21e5064" name="xd21e5064src">83</a> haunt this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name=
"pb329">329</a>]</span>place? and does not the Purgametsch conceal a
village which was buried for its sins? Is it not just here that lurk
the Angane and the Bergostan&ouml;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5072src"
href="#xd21e5072" name="xd21e5072src">84</a>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, I can undertake to defend you against all these
chimerical fancies,&rdquo; replied Giuseppa, scornfully; &ldquo;but if
you don&rsquo;t feel any confidence in me, it is absurd our attempting
to live together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not that&mdash;I have told you it is not that!&rdquo;
cried Clamer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then shall we do it?&rdquo; urged she. Thus driven, Clamer
could not choose but give in; and Giuseppa sent her monster birds to
conceal the treasure they bore, in the hole she pointed out high up in
the rocks, and remain in guard over it.</p>
<p>This done they sped over the pleasant <i>Fleimserthal</i> and
Cembrathal to Trient.</p>
<p>Eligio Righi received his returning envoy with a hearty welcome, and
listened without wearying to his frequent repetition of the tale of his
adventures. The part where he described the manner in which he had
administered the chastisement on the Devil was what delighted him most,
and the account of the roaring of the Devil with the pain.</p>
<p>Moreover, he kept his word, and opened his house and his purse to
Clamer, who shared every thing as if it had been his own, and even
obtained his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name=
"pb330">330</a>]</span>sanction to bring home his wife, though he durst
not tell him how he obtained her.</p>
<p>Giuseppa had now not only a fine house and broad lands, and plenty
of servants and clothes, and every thing she wished for, but she had
only to send one of her birds to the treasury in the Fassathal to
supply all her caprices as well as wants&mdash;yet she was always
complaining and quarrelling. Pangrazio often found her quite
unbearable; but he remembered she was his wife, and he forgave her,
though the more he gave in, the more unreasonable she got.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it must not be supposed that Luxehale had never
awaked. True, he slept on for a good week, as Giuseppa had predicted,
but that over, he woke up in a pretty passion at finding she had
escaped.</p>
<p>With all her evil temper, Giuseppa had suited him very well; he
rather enjoyed an occasional broil, it was much more to his taste than
peace and amity&mdash;and besides, he was sure always to get the best
of it. So he determined that this time, instead of going in search of a
new wife, he would get the old one back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who come to me in the way she did,&rdquo; he reflected,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t escape so easily. The others I more or less
deceived. They came with me thinking I was one of their own sort; but
she followed me with her eyes open&mdash;she knew all about me before
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>she came. Besides, they hated the place the
moment they found out where they were, but she knew what it was, and
yet liked it all along. No, I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s of the sort
that go back in thorough earnest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he dressed himself up in his best, put a plume in his hat and a
flower in his button-hole, and went off to Trient. He had not watched
the house where Giuseppa lived many days before he heard her voice
raised to that angry key he knew so well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do for me,&rdquo; he said, rubbing his hands.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all going on right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want more?&rdquo; he heard Clamer plead.
&ldquo;If there is any thing I can do to please you, I will do
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a fool! and there&rsquo;s nothing in you <i>can</i>
please me,&rdquo; screamed Giuseppa, too angry to be pacified;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re not like Luxehale. Why did you ever take me away
from him? <i>He</i> was something to look at!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going on all right!&rdquo; said Luxehale,
chuckling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you come away?&rdquo; said Pangrazio, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what I was about! Would that I had never
done it!&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; replied Pangrazio,
imploringly. But instead of being won by his kindness she only grew the
more noisy, till at last Pangrazio <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332"
href="#pb332" name="pb332">332</a>]</span>could stand it no longer, and
he went out to avoid growing angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is my time!&rdquo; said the Devil; and he slipped round
to the window. Giuseppa was still fretting and fuming, and invoking
Luxehale at the top of her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am!&rdquo; said Luxehale. &ldquo;Will you come back
with me, and leave this stupid loafer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>you</i> there!&rdquo; cried Giuseppa, rushing to the
window, and kissing him. &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll go with you. Take
me away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; jump down!&rdquo; said Luxehale, helping her over
the window-sill. Giuseppa threw herself into his arms, and away they
walked. Arrived outside the town, Luxehale lifted her up, spread his
black bat&rsquo;s wings, and carried her off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go through the <i>Fleimserthal</i> and the Fassathal,&rdquo;
said Giuseppa; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something to show you
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any thing to please you!&rdquo; answered Luxehale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not to please <i>me</i>!&rdquo; cried
Giuseppa, taking offence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t begin again; it won&rsquo;t do with
me!&rdquo; replied Luxehale, with a sternness he had never before
exercised. &ldquo;Mind, I don&rsquo;t mean to allow any more of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if that&rsquo;s to be it,&rdquo; said Giuseppa,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back again to Pangrazio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; replied Luxehale; &ldquo;you
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name=
"pb333">333</a>]</span>don&rsquo;t go back any more, I&rsquo;ll take
good care of that! And now, what did you want to come by the Fassathal
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only because it&rsquo;s the way I passed with Pangrazio, and
it renewed a sweet memory of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do for me! What was the real
reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you give me if I tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. But if you <i>don&rsquo;t</i> tell me, I shall know
how to make you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giuseppa&rsquo;s courage failed her when she heard him talk like
this. She knew she had given herself to him of her own will, and so she
belonged to him, and she could not help herself; and now, the best
course she could think of was to tell him of the treasure, and trust to
the good humour it would put him in, for he was very avaricious, to get
her forgiveness out of him.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Clamer came back from a walk outside the town&mdash;where he had
gone to get cool after his wife&rsquo;s scolding&mdash;just in time to
see Luxehale spread his wings and fly away with Giuseppa in his arms.
He called to her, but she did not hear him; and all he could do was to
stand watching them till they were out of sight.</p>
<p>He came back so gloomy and dejected that his friend Eligio Righi was
quite distressed to see him. He was so sympathizing, indeed, that
Pangrazio <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=
"pb334">334</a>]</span>could not forbear telling him the whole story.
&ldquo;Then, if that is so, you need not regret being quit of
her,&rdquo; moralized his sage friend: &ldquo;she was no wife for an
honest man. And as for the treasure, you have enough without that. It
was but ill-gotten gain which came to you for knowledge obtained from
such a source.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href=

OR,<br>
THE BOY WHO WENT OUT TO DISCOVER WHAT FEAR MEANT.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Zovanin was a bold boy, and never seemed to be afraid
of any thing. When other children were afraid lest Orco<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5197src" href="#xd21e5197" name=
"xd21e5197src">86</a> should play them some of his malicious tricks,
when people cried out to him, &ldquo;Take care, and don&rsquo;t walk in
those footprints, they may be those of Orco!&rdquo; he would only
laugh, and say, &ldquo;Let Orco come; I should like to see him!&rdquo;
When he was sent out upon the mountains with the herds, and had to be
alone with them through the dark nights, and his mother bid
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name=
"pb336">336</a>]</span>him not be afraid, he used to stare at her with
his great round eyes as if he wondered what she meant. If a lamb or a
goat strayed over a difficult precipice, and the neighbours cried out
to him, &ldquo;Let be; it is not safe to go after it down that steep
place,&rdquo; he would seem to think they were making game of him, and
would swing himself over the steep as firmly and as steadily as if he
were merely bestriding a hedge. He saw people shun passing through the
churchyards by dark, and so he used to make it his habit to sleep every
night on the graves; and as they said they were afraid of being struck
blind if they slept in the moonlight, he would always choose to lie
where the moonbeams fell. Nor thunder, nor avalanche, nor fire, nor
flood, nor storm seemed to have any terror for him; so that at last
people set him to do every kind of thing they were afraid to do
themselves, and he got so much wondered at, that he said, &ldquo;I will
go abroad over the world, and see if I can find any where this same
Fear that I hear people talk of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he went out, and walked along by the most desolate paths and
through frightful stony wildernesses, till he came to a village where
there <span class="corr" id="xd21e5204" title="Source: wasa">was
a</span> fair <span class="corr" id="xd21e5207" title=
"Source: goingon">going on</span>. Zovanin was too tired to care much
for the dance, so instead of joining it he asked for a bed.</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;A bed!&rdquo; said the host; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I can
give you least of all. My beds are for regular customers, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name="pb337">337</a>]</span>and
not for strollers who drop down from the skies;&rdquo; for, being full
of business at the moment, he was uppish and haughty, as if his
day&rsquo;s prosperity was to last for ever.</p>
<p>While Zovanin was urging that his money was as good as
another&rsquo;s, and the host growing more and more insolent while
repeating that he could not receive him, a terrific shouting of men,
and screeching of women made itself heard, and pell-mell the whole
tribe of peasants, pedlars, and showmen came rushing towards the inn,
flying helter-skelter before a furious and gigantic maniac brandishing
a formidable club. Every one ran for dear life, seeking what shelter
they could find. The inn was filled to overflowing in a trice, and
those who could not find entrance there hid themselves in the stables
and pig-styes and cellars. But no one was in so great a hurry to hide
himself as mine host, who had been so loud with his blustering to a
defenceless stranger anon. Only, when he saw the baffled madman
breaking in his doors and windows with his massive oaken staff, he put
his head dolefully out of the topmost window, and piteously entreated
<i>some one</i> to put a stop to the havoc.</p>
<p>Zovanin was not quick-witted: all this noisy scene had been
transacted and it had not yet occurred to him to move from the spot
where he originally stood; in fact, he had hardly apprehended what it
was that was taking place, only at last the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>host&rsquo;s vehement gesticulations suggested
to him that he wanted the madman arrested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it, is it?&rdquo; said Zovanin. &ldquo;All
right, I&rsquo;m your man!&rdquo; and walking up coolly to the cause of
all this disturbance, he said, in the tone of one who meant to be
obeyed, &ldquo;Give me your club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor imbecile was usually harmless enough; he lived in an
out-of-the-way hut with his family, where he seldom saw a stranger.
They had incautiously brought him up to the <i>f&ecirc;te</i>, where he
had first become excited by the sight of the unwonted number of people;
then some thoughtless youths had further provoked him by mocking and
laughing at him; and when the people ran away in fear of his
retaliation, he had only yielded to a natural impulse in running after
them. But when Zovanin stood before him, fearless and collected, and
said, in his blunt, quiet way, &ldquo;Give me your club,&rdquo; his
habitual obedience prevailed over the momentary ebullition, and he
yielded himself up <span class="corr" id="xd21e5238" title=
"Source: peacably">peaceably</span> to the guidance of the young giant.
Zovanin first secured the club, and then desired the madman to bestow
himself in an empty shed, of which he closed and made fast the door.
When the landlord and people saw the coast clear they all came out
again, the latter losing no time in going back to their games, the
former to resume his preparations for the entertainment of his
guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Zovanin, &ldquo;I suppose <i>now</i>
you&rsquo;ll <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=
"pb339">339</a>]</span>make no difficulty in providing me a bed? I
think that&rsquo;s the least you can do for me, after my befriending
you as I have. I have earned it, if any one has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! you think that such a great feat, do you?&rdquo; said
the landlord, who, deeming the madman well secured, felt no compunction
in disowning Johnny&rsquo;s service. &ldquo;Do you suppose any other
couldn&rsquo;t have said, &lsquo;Give me your club,&rsquo; just as well
as you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you would like to try,&rdquo; replied our hero; and
he went to unbar the shed-door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, no!&rdquo; screamed the cowardly
landlord, preparing to run away. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him loose on
any account; I&rsquo;ll do <i>any thing</i> for you sooner than
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know what I want; it&rsquo;s not much, and
reasonable enough,&rdquo; replied Fearless Johnny, relaxing his hold of
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s just <i>the one</i> thing I
<i>can&rsquo;t</i> do,&rdquo; lamented the host. &ldquo;My beds are
bespoken to customers who come every year to the fair, and if I
disappoint any of them I&rsquo;m a ruined man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then, here goes!&rdquo; and Zovanin once more
prepared to open the shed-door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; stop!&rdquo; roared the landlord. &ldquo;Perhaps
there is a way, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; ejaculated Johnny; &ldquo;I thought as
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a room, in fact a whole suite of rooms, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name="pb340">340</a>]</span>and
a magnificent suite of rooms, I daren&rsquo;t give to any one else, but
I think they will do for you, as you are such a stout-hearted
chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see that castle on the tip of the high rock yonder,
that looks like an eagle perched for a moment and ready to take
flight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should rather think I did, seeing it&rsquo;s one of the
most remarkable sights I have met with in all my travels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that castle was built by a bad giant who lived here in
former times; and he balanced it like that on the tip of the rock, and
only he had the secret of walking into it. If any one else steps into
it, they are pretty sure of stepping on the wrong place, and down will
go the whole castle overbalanced into the abyss. When he was once
inside it, he had an iron chain by which he made it fast to the rock;
and when he went out he used to set it swinging as you see, so that no
one might dare to venture in and take back possession of the booty
which he seized right and left from all the country round. If you
don&rsquo;t mind trying your luck at taking possession of the castle,
you can lodge there like a prince, for there are twelve ghosts, who
come there every night, who will supply you with every thing you can
ask for. So there is all you desire to have, and more, provided only
the idea does not strike you with fear.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name="pb341">341</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear, say you?&rdquo; said Zovanin, opening his great round
eyes; &ldquo;do you say I shall find &lsquo;Fear&rsquo; in yonder
castle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most assuredly. Every body finds it in merely listening to
the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s what I came out to seek; so show me the
way, and there I will lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The host stared at his crack-brained guest, but, glad to be rid of
his importunity for a night&rsquo;s lodging in the inn, made no delay
in pointing out the path which led to the giant&rsquo;s castle.</p>
<p>Zovanin trudged along it without hesitation, nor was he long in
reaching the precariously balanced edifice. Once before the entrance,
he had little difficulty in seeing what was required in order to take
possession. Just in the centre of the building a large stone stood up
prominently, and though at a great distance from the threshold, was
probably not more than a stride for the giant of old&mdash;as a further
token, it was worn away at the edge, evidently where he had stepped on
to it. Zovanin saw it could be reached by a bold spring, and, having no
fear of making a false step, he was able to calculate his distance
without disturbance from nervousness. Having balanced himself
successfully on the stone, he next set himself to fix the chain which
attached his airy castle to the rock, and then made his way through its
various apartments. Every thing was very clean and in good order, for
the twelve ghosts came every <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href=
"#pb342" name="pb342">342</a>]</span>night and put all to rights.
Zovanin had hardly finished making his round when in they came, all
dressed in white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me a bottle of wine, and some bread and meat, candles
and cards,&rdquo; said Fearless Johnny, just as if he had been giving
an order to the waiter of an inn; for he remembered that the landlord
had said they would supply him, and he felt no fear which should make
him shrink from them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where this same Fear can be?&rdquo; he said, as the
ghosts were preparing his supper; &ldquo;I have been pretty well all
over the castle already, and can see nothing of him. Oh, yes! I will
just go down and explore the cellars, perhaps I shall find him down
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; go down and choose your wine to your own taste, and you
will find him there, sure enough,&rdquo; said the twelve ghosts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I, though?&rdquo; said John, delighted; and down he
went.</p>
<p>The bottles were all in order, labelled with the names of various
choice vintages in such tempting variety that he was puzzled which to
choose. At last, however, he stretched his hand out to reach down a
bottle from a high shelf, when lo and behold a grinning skull showed
itself in the place where the bottle had stood, and asked him how he
dared meddle with the wine! Without being in the least disconcerted at
its horrid appearance, Fearless <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343"
href="#pb343" name="pb343">343</a>]</span>Johnny passed the bottle into
his left hand, and with his right taking up the skull, flung it over
his shoulder to the farthermost corner of the cellar. He had no sooner
done so, however, than a long bony arm was stretched out from the same
place, and made a grab at the bottle. But Fearless John caught the arm
and flung it after the skull. Immediately another arm appeared, and was
treated in the same way; then came a long, lanky leg, and tried to kick
him on the nose, but Johnny dealt with it as with the others; then came
another leg, which he sent flying into the corner too; and then the
ribs and spine, till all the bones of a skeleton had severally appeared
before him, and had all been cast by him on to the same shapeless
heap.</p>
<p>Now he turned to go, but as he did so a great rattling was heard in
the corner where he had thrown the bones. It was all the bones joining
themselves together and forming themselves into a perfect skeleton,
which came clatter-patter after him up the stairs.</p>
<p>Zovanin neither turned to look at it nor hurried his pace, but
walked straight back, bottle in hand, into the room where the supper
was laid ready, and the pack of cards by the side, as he had ordered.
All the while that he was supping, the skeleton kept up a wild dance
round him, trying to excite him by menacing gestures, but Fearless
Johnny munched his bread and meat and drank his wine, and took
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name=
"pb344">344</a>]</span>no more notice than of the insects buzzing round
the sconces.</p>
<p>When he had done he called to the ghosts in the coolest way
imaginable to clear away the things, and then dealt out the cards, with
one hand for a &ldquo;dummy&rdquo; and one for himself. He had no
sooner done this than the skeleton sat down, with a horrid grimace of
triumph, and took up the &ldquo;dummy&rsquo;s&rdquo; hand!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t grin like that,&rdquo; said Johnny;
&ldquo;you may depend on it I shouldn&rsquo;t have let you take the
cards if it hadn&rsquo;t pleased me. If you know how to play, play
on&mdash;it is much better fun than playing both hands oneself. Only,
if you don&rsquo;t know how to play, you leave them alone&mdash;and you
had better not give me reason to turn you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The skeleton, however, understood the game very well, and with
alternate fortune they played and passed away the hours till it was
time to go to bed. Johnny then rose and called the twelve ghosts to
light him up to bed, which they did in gravest order. He had no sooner
laid himself to sleep than, with a great clatter, the skeleton came in
and pulled the bedclothes off him. In a great passion Fearless Johnny
jumped up, and brandishing a chair over his head, threatened to break
every one of his bones if he didn&rsquo;t immediately lay the clothes
straight again. The skeleton had no defence for his bones, and so could
not choose but obey; and Johnny went quietly to bed again. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name="pb345">345</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a pity I didn&rsquo;t ask the poor fellow what ailed
him, though,&rdquo; said Johnny, when he was once more alone.
&ldquo;Perhaps he too is tormented by this &lsquo;Fear&rsquo; that
every one thinks so much of, and wanted me to help him. Ah, well, if he
comes again I will ask him;&rdquo; and with that he rolled himself up
in the quilt, and went to sleep again. An hour had hardly passed before
the skeleton came in again, and this time he shook the bedpost so
violently that he woke Johnny with a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! there he is again!&rdquo; cried Johnny; &ldquo;now
I&rsquo;ll ask him what he wants;&rdquo; so he jumped out of bed once
more, and addressed the skeleton solemnly in these words:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="it" class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd21e1688">&ldquo;Anima terrena,</p>
<p class="line">Stammi lontana tre passi,</p>
<p class="line">E raccontami la tua pena<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5337src" href="#xd21e5337" name="xd21e5337src">87</a>!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Then the skeleton made a sign to him to follow it, and
led him down to the foundations of the castle, where there was a big
block of porphyry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heave up that block,&rdquo; said the skeleton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I!&rdquo; replied Johnny; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t set it
there, and so I&rsquo;m not going to take it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the skeleton took up the block itself, and under it lay shining
two immense jars full of gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take them, and count them out,&rdquo; said the skeleton.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name=
"pb346">346</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I!&rdquo; said Johnny; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t heap them
up, and so I&rsquo;m not going to count them out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the skeleton counted them out itself, and they contained ten
thousand gold pieces each.</p>
<p>When it had done, it said, &ldquo;I am the giant who built this
castle. I have waited here these hundreds of years till one came
fearless enough to do what you have done to-night, and now I am free,
because to you I may give over the castle; so take it, for it is yours,
and with it one of these jars of gold, which is enough to make you
rich, but take the other jar of gold and build a church, and let them
pray for me, and learn to be better men than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he disappeared, and Fearless Johnny slept quietly for the
rest of the night.</p>
<p>In the morning, when the sun was up, and the birds began to sing
cheerily on the branches, the landlord began to feel some compunction
for having abandoned such a fine young Bursch to a night by himself
among the unquiet spirits; so he summoned all his courage, and all his
servants, and all his neighbours, and, thus prepared, he led the way up
to the haunted castle. Finding that it was firmly fixed by the chain,
they all entered in a body, for none durst be the first; and the
entrance, having been made for the giant, was big enough for all.</p>
<p>Zovanin having had such a disturbed night was still fast asleep, but
their footsteps and anxious whisperings woke him. In answer to all
their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347" name=
"pb347">347</a>]</span>questionings he gave an account of what had
happened to him, but still complained that, after all, he had not been
able to find Fear!</p>
<p>Zovanin was now a rich man, and had a mighty castle to live in where
he might have ended his days in peace, but he was always possessed by
the desire of finding out what Fear was, and this desire was too strong
to let him rest.</p>
<p>The neighbours, however, told him he might find Fear out hunting;
and many were the hunting-parties he established, and wherever the wild
game was shyest, there he sought it out. Once, as he sprang over a
chasm his horse made a false start, and was plunged into the abyss, but
Fearless Johnny caught at the bough of a birch-tree that waved over the
mountain-side. The branch cracked, and it seemed as if nothing could
save him, but Fearless Johnny only swung himself on to another on the
ledge below, and climbed back by its means to the path. Another time,
as he was pursuing a chamois up a precipitous track, a great mass of
loose rock, detached from the height above, came thundering down upon
him. An ordinary hunter, scared at the sight, would have given himself
up for lost, but Fearless Johnny stood quite still and let it bound
over his head, and he came to no harm.</p>
<p>So he still was unable to find Fear. After some years, therefore, he
once more went abroad to seek it. This time, however, he provided
himself with a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name=
"pb348">348</a>]</span>fine suit of armour and a prancing charger, and
a noble figure he cut as he ambled forth.</p>
<p>After a long journey, with many adventures, he came one hot day, as
he was very thirsty, to a fountain of water in the outskirts of a town,
and as he dismounted to drink he observed that the whole place looked
sad and deserted; the road was grass-grown, and the houses seemed
neglected and empty. As he went up to the fountain to drink, a faint
voice called to him from the wayside, &ldquo;Beware, and do it not!
Think you that we all should be lying here dying of thirst if you could
drink at that fountain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he looked round, and saw that, as far as eye could reach, the
banks of the wayside were covered with dying people heaped up one on
the other, and all gazing towards the fountain!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know you not,&rdquo; continued the weary voice, &ldquo;that a
terrible dragon has taken possession of all the fountains; and that the
moment one goes to drink of them he appears, as though he would eat you
up, so that you are bound to run away for very fear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fear!&rsquo;&rdquo; cried Zovanin; &ldquo;is Fear here
at last?&rdquo; and he joyfully ran to the side of the well.</p>
<p>All the weary, dying people raised themselves as well as they could,
to see what should befall him who was not afraid of the terrible
dragon.</p>
<p>But Fearless Johnny went up to the fountain&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href="#pb349" name="pb349">349</a>]</span>brim
to dip his hand into the cooling flood. Before he could do so, however,
the terrible dragon put his head up through the midst, with a frightful
howl, and spueing fire out of his nostrils. Zovanin, instead of drawing
back, instantly took out his sword and, with one blow, severed the
monster&rsquo;s head from the trunk! Then all the people rushed to the
fountain, hailing him as their deliverer. But ere they had slaked their
thirst, the dragon, which had sunk back into the depth of the water,
reappeared with a new head, already full grown, and more terrible than
the last, for it not only spued out fire from its nostrils, but darted
living sparks from its eyes.</p>
<p>When the people saw this they all ran away screaming, and Zovanin
was left alone; but, as usual, he did not lose heart, and with another
well-aimed blow sent the second head of the monster rolling by the side
of the first!</p>
<p>The people came back, and began to drink again when they saw the
huge trunk disappear beneath the surface; but it was not many minutes
before another head cropped up, more terrible than either of the
preceding, for it not only spued fire from its nostrils and darted
living sparks from its eyes, but it had hair and mane of flames, which
waved and rolled abroad, threatening all within reach. All the people
fled at the sight, and Zovanin was once more left alone with the
monster. Once more <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350"
name="pb350">350</a>]</span>he severed the terrible head; and after
this the dragon was seen no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be very wonderful blood out of which three heads
can spring,&rdquo; thought Fearless Johnny; and he filled a vial with
the dragon&rsquo;s blood, and journeyed farther.</p>
<p>After a time he came to the outskirts of another town. It was not
deserted like the last. The streets were full of people making
merry&mdash;in fact, every one was so very merry that they seemed a
whole community of madmen. Another might have been afraid to encounter
them at all; but not so Fearless Johnny, he spurred his horse and rode
right through their midst. But for all his seeming so fearless and
self-possessed, the people got round him, and seized his horse&rsquo;s
bridle, and dragged him from the saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want with me, good people?&rdquo; cried Zovanin;
&ldquo;let me hear, before you pull me to pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they found him so cool, spite of the wild way in which they had
handled him, they began to respect him, and loosed their hold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to know,&rdquo; answered one, &ldquo;it is soon
told. We are all in this town wholly given up to amusement. We have
done with work and toil, and do nothing but dance, and drink, and sing,
and divert ourselves from morning to night. But after enjoying all this
a long time, we begin to find <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351"
href="#pb351" name="pb351">351</a>]</span>it rather wearisome, and we
are almost as tired of our pastime as we used to be of our labour. So
the king has decreed that every stranger who comes by this way shall be
caught, and required to find us a quite new diversion, and if he cannot
do that, we will make him dance on red-hot stones, and flog him round
the town, and get some fun out of him that way, at all events; as you
don&rsquo;t look very likely to find us a new pastime, we may as well
begin with putting you on your death-dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make too sure of that!&rdquo; said Fearless
Johnny, not at all disconcerted; &ldquo;take me to your king, and
I&rsquo;ll show you a diversion you never heard of before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he came to the king, the king laughed, and would hardly listen
to him, because he looked so broad and heavy, and not at all like one
who could invent a merry game.</p>
<p>But Johnny protested that if they would let him cut off any
one&rsquo;s head, he would stick it on just as before, and the man
should be never the worse.</p>
<p>The king was greatly delighted with the idea, and most anxious to
see the performance, promising that he would not only let him go free
if he succeeded, but would load him with honours and presents into the
bargain. Zovanin professed himself quite ready to prove his skill, but
no one could be found who was willing to let the experiment be tried on
him.</p>
<p>This angered the king greatly; and at last he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name=
"pb352">352</a>]</span>called forward his jester, and ordered Zovanin
to make the trial on him.</p>
<p>The jester, however, objected as much as any one else, only, as he
belonged entirely to the king, he could not disobey him. &ldquo;But
think, your majesty,&rdquo; said the poor hunchback, &ldquo;what will
your majesty do without his jester, if this quack does not succeed in
his promises?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I <i>shall</i> succeed!&rdquo; thundered Fearless Johnny;
and he spoke with such assurance, that the king and all the people were
more desirous than ever to see the feat, and cried to him to commence.
When the jester found that all hope of wriggling out of the cruel
decree was vain, he threw himself on his knees, and begged so earnestly
that the king would grant him two favours, that he could not resist.
The two favours were, that he should have the satisfaction of repeating
the trick on Johnny, if he allowed him to try his skill on him, and
also that he should first give proof of what he could do on the ape,
with whose pranks he was wont to amuse the king.</p>
<p>The king and Zovanin both agreed to the two requests, and the poor
ape was brought forward, and delivered over to make the first
essay.</p>
<p>Zovanin did not keep the breathless multitude long in suspense; with
one blow he severed its head, threw it up high in the air, that all
might see it was well cut off, and then placed it on again, smearing in
some drops of the dragon&rsquo;s blood by <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb353" href="#pb353" name="pb353">353</a>]</span>way of cement. The
head and trunk were scarcely placed together again, with the
dragon&rsquo;s blood between, than the ape bounded up as well as
before, and just as if nothing had been done to him; but, on the
contrary, finding himself the object of great attention, and excited by
the shouts of the people, he sprang and gambolled about from side to
side with even greater alacrity than his wont.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Sir Hunchback!&rdquo; cried Zovanin, &ldquo;it is your
turn. You see it&rsquo;s not very bad; so come along, and no more
excuses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go it, hunchback!&rdquo; said the king; and all the people
shouted, &ldquo;The hunchback&rsquo;s head! the hunchback&rsquo;s
head!&rdquo; with such vehemence that it was evident there was no means
of getting out of the trial. It was true, Zovanin had proved he
<i>could</i> put a head on again; but the jester shrank from the cold
steel nevertheless, and it was only with a look which concentrated all
his venom that he yielded himself up. Fearless Johnny struck off his
head in a trice, then threw it up high in the air, as he had done the
ape&rsquo;s, and then cemented it on again with the dragon&rsquo;s
blood as well as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for you!&rdquo; screamed the hunchback, when he found his
head back in its right place once more.</p>
<p>Zovanin had no fear, but sat down on the ground instantly, so that
the hunchback might reach him more conveniently. &ldquo;This is all you
have to do,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354"
name="pb354">354</a>]</span>he said: &ldquo;take my sword in your two
hands, and swing it round across my throat. Then pour the contents of
this vial over the stump of the throat, and clap the head down on it
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes! I think I ought to know how it&rsquo;s done, as
well as you,&rdquo; answered the dwarf, hastily; and he swung the sword
round with a will, sending Johnny&rsquo;s head rolling at the
king&rsquo;s feet. The people caught it up and handed it round; and it
might soon have got lost in the crowd, but that the king shouted to
them to bring it back, because he wanted to see it stuck on again. So
they gave it back to the jester, and he smeared the rest of the
dragon&rsquo;s blood over the stump of the throat&mdash;but in putting
the head on, took care to turn it the wrong way, which, as he managed
to bend over Johnny&rsquo;s recumbent body, no one observed till he
rose to his feet. Then all the people screeched, and yelled, and
shouted, so that John could not make out what was the matter, but,
getting angry, demanded his horse, that he might ride away from them
all.</p>
<p>The king ordered his horse to be brought, and Johnny sprang into the
saddle, and the cries of the people made the beast start away faster
even than Johnny himself wished; only Johnny could not make out why he
seemed to him, for all his urging, always to go backwards.</p>
<p>At last, he got quite away from the shouts of the people, into a
calm, quiet place, where there was a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb355" href="#pb355" name="pb355">355</a>]</span>lake shut in by high
hills, which, with the mulberry-trees, and vines, and grassy slopes,
were all pictured in the lake&rsquo;s smooth face.</p>
<p>Zovanin was hot with his ride, and so was his mount; so he walked
him into the shallow water, while he himself dismounted, and bent down
to drink.</p>
<p>At the sight that met his gaze in the water, a shout burst from his
lips more terrible than the shouts of all the people. He gazed again,
and couldn&rsquo;t think what had befallen him; but, so horrified was
he at the sight of his own back where he was wont to see his breast,
that he fell down and died of fear on the spot! And thus Fear visited
him at last&mdash;in a way which would certainly never have occurred,
if the jester had put his head on again in the way nature designed for
it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356" name=

<h3 class="main">THE DOVE-MAIDEN.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the days when heathenism still disputed the advance
of Christianity in Tirol, there lived a nobleman in a castle, of which
no trace now remains, overlooking the egg-shaped Lago di Molveno. The
nobleman and his family had embraced the teaching of St. Vigilius, and
were among his most pious and obedient disciples. Eligio, his eldest
son, however, had two faults which led him into great trouble, as our
story will show; but as he was of a good disposition, and was always
desirous to make amends for his wrong-doing, he found help and favour,
which kept him right in the main. His two faults were&mdash;an excess
of fondness for card-playing and an inclination to think he knew better
than his elders, which led him to go counter to good advice.</p>
<p>It so happened that whenever he played at cards he always won; and
this made it such a pleasure that he could not be persuaded to leave it
off, though he knew he was wasting all the time he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name=
"pb357">357</a>]</span>ought to have devoted to more manly pursuits.
Nor was there for a long time any lack of people to play with him, for
every one said his luck must turn at last, and each thought he should
be the fortunate person in whose favour this would happen. But when at
last they found he still won, and won on, they got shy of the risk, and
refused to incur it any more.</p>
<p>When Eligio found this to be the case, he determined to travel
abroad, and play against strangers. His parents tried to make use of
the opportunity to lead him to break with his bad habit, but it was of
no avail, and, as experience is a good school, they agreed to let him
go forth and see what the world was made of.</p>
<p>It was a brave sight as he descended the terrace of the castle
accoutred in the noble array befitting his rank, and with a retinue of
followers handsomely attired too. But his lady mother watched him
depart with a boding heart, and then went into the chapel to pray that
he might be preserved amid all dangers.</p>
<p>Nothing particular occurred to mar the pleasure of travel for
several days, till he came to a large and fertile plain, studded with
many towns, whose white stone-built houses sparkled in the sun.
&ldquo;Ha! now we come to life and human kind again!&rdquo; cried
Eligio; and putting spurs to his steed he rode joyously to the first of
these smiling towns. It had no lofty towers, no heaven-pointing
spires&mdash;nowhere was seen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb358"
href="#pb358" name="pb358">358</a>]</span>the sign of the saving cross,
which from boyhood he had been taught to reverence and to see planted
every where before him in consecration of every affair of life. But
there were sounds of mirth and revelry, as of a perpetual feast, and
all around the place was gay with dancers and mummers, musicians,
dice-throwers, and card-players. Eligio wandered about till he saw a
number of these making up a fresh party, and courteously asked to be
allowed to join them. They accepted his company willingly, and fortune
favoured him as usual. Again and again he tried, and it was always the
same. It was as much as his train of followers, numerous as they were,
could do to gather in and take charge of all his gains. The
stranger&rsquo;s unvarying luck became the talk of the place, and all
the people collected to see him play.</p>
<p>Towards evening there came amid the crowd a tall man of serious
mien, who, having watched his play with much attention, said to him, as
he saw him complete a game which gave him once more the benefit of a
considerable haul,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly, you are an expert player, young man; I had thought
myself hitherto the best of our countryside, but I doubt me if I should
be right to measure my skill with yours. However, you must be tired
with your long travel and with the excitement of the day&rsquo;s play,
and if you will honour my poor board with your presence at dinner I
will ask you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359" name=
"pb359">359</a>]</span>afterwards to let me try my power against yours
with the cards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eligio thanked him for his courteous speech, and assured him he
should have the greatest pleasure in doing as he wished.</p>
<p>The stranger then led him to his abode, which was appointed with a
sumptuousness such as had never entered into Eligio&rsquo;s dreams in
his mountain home. Marble courts and fountains, surrounded by bowers of
exquisite flowers, formed the approach, and then they passed beneath
endless-seeming arcades of polished marble into a vast alcove encrusted
with alabaster of many colours, the dim light only reaching through its
clear golden veins, no sound disturbing its still repose but the cool
murmur of a fountain which fed a marble lake. Here noiseless attendants
advanced, and, having helped Eligio and his host to undress, afforded
him a delicious bath, complete with ministrations of unguents and
scents&mdash;very different from the plunge into the icy waters of the
Lago di Molveno, which was his greatest luxury at home.</p>
<p>They now arrayed him in an entirely new suit of superb attire; and
then, to the sound of hushed music, led him and his host through the
arched corridors to a banqueting-hall, where every thing of the
choicest was ready laid.</p>
<p>Nothing could have been more delightful than the charming and
accomplished conversation of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb360"
href="#pb360" name="pb360">360</a>]</span>hospitable entertainer, who,
when the long succession of various viands was at length exhausted,
proposed that they should repair to an upper room and commence their
game.</p>
<p>Delighted as Eligio had been with his extraordinary entertainment,
he was yet burning to try his luck with his obliging host, and
accordingly followed him with alacrity to a divan spread on the roof,
having for its only covering a leafy <i>pergola</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5498src" href="#xd21e5498" name="xd21e5498src">88</a>, and
lighted by lamps contrived with such art that they seemed to be the
very bunches of grapes themselves which gave the rays.</p>
<p>The cards were brought, and the friends set to work. The first game
was a long one; the host seemed to be in great fear of not succeeding,
and pondered every throw. Eligio played in his own rough-and-ready
style, expecting luck to come as it always had&mdash;he never troubled
himself <i>how</i>.</p>
<p>But this time luck did <i>not</i> come to him, and his entertainer
was the winner! The stakes were large, but his hospitable friend had
been so urbane throughout, that he could not show any ill-will. His
attendants were called in, and paid the debt.</p>
<p>The winner put up the cards as though he did not wish to play
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, you must give me my revenge,&rdquo; said Eligio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly, <i>if you wish it</i>,&rdquo; he replied; and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href="#pb361" name=
"pb361">361</a>]</span>they played again. This time Eligio paid more
attention to his style, and calculated every card he played; but it was
of no use, he was beaten again. Caring more for the disappointment than
the loss, he saw the money counted out without a sigh; but the unusual
sense of having been overcome rankled in his mind. He had offered to
play high because it seemed required by the princely character of the
house where he had been so sumptuously received; and of all the
treasure he had brought with him, and of all he had won through a
day&rsquo;s undeviating luck, there only remained enough to repeat the
stakes. Nevertheless he pledged the same sum once more, and they played
again.</p>
<p>This time fortune seemed to have come back to him. All went right up
to the end; Eligio&rsquo;s heart felt lightened. So luck was coming
back, was it? He played with an interest which he had almost ceased to
find&mdash;but his adversary threw down his last card which reversed
every thing, and once more he was the winner!</p>
<p>Eligio called in his followers, and ordered them to pay out the last
farthing of his treasure; but even this distressed him less than having
nothing more to stake, whereby to have a chance of retrieving his luck.
&ldquo;Let be,&rdquo; said his new friend, soothingly; &ldquo;perhaps
to-morrow your luck will turn. Come down with me to supper, and have a
quiet night&rsquo;s rest, and think no more about the play.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362" name=
"pb362">362</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t rest, and I can&rsquo;t eat!&rdquo; said
Eligio; &ldquo;I can do nothing till my luck turns. I must stake
<i>something</i>. Ah! there&rsquo;s my horse&mdash;but that&rsquo;s not
enough. Put along with it all my retainers. If I lose, they shall be
yours, and serve you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you insist, I have no objection,&rdquo; said his host.
&ldquo;My men know their service well, and will not shame you if you
win and I have to render you an equal number of them; and for your
horse, I can match him, how good soever he may be, with the swiftest
Arab in the whole world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eligio sat down, hardly heeding his words, intent only on
re-establishing his success. But his pains were vain; the game went
against him like the last, and, scarcely mastering his vexation, he
called in his retainers and told them they had passed into the service
of the new master.</p>
<p>But this only left him in the same position as before. Still he
wanted to retrieve his fortune, and again he had no stake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it for to-night,&rdquo; recommended his host;
&ldquo;better times will come with the morrow.&rdquo; But Eligio would
not hear of it; the passion and excitement were too strong within him;
he could not turn to other thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Myself! my life! that is all I have left to play. Will you
accept the wager of my life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you insist,&rdquo; replied his host, &ldquo;I have no
objection, but it is an odd sort of play. I really never <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href="#pb363" name=
"pb363">363</a>]</span>heard of such a thing before; but any thing to
oblige you&mdash;though I really advise you to leave it till the
morning, when you are cooler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And all the time he was a magician of the heathen, who had invited
Eligio for the express purpose of bringing him to this strait; but, as
he saw how impetuous and excited he was, he knew that he would but fall
into his snare the more surely for whetting his ardour with a little
opposition.</p>
<p>Eligio would, indeed, listen to no mention of delay, and they sat
down and played&mdash;with the same result as before! His life was now
at the magician&rsquo;s disposal, and he stood in a desponding
attitude, waiting to hear what the magician decided to do with him.</p>
<p>As he stood there, however, a great cry rose in the room
beyond&mdash;a cry of a young maiden&rsquo;s voice in
distress&mdash;and from under the <i lang="it">usciale</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5555src" href="#xd21e5555" name=
"xd21e5555src">89</a> came running, in terror for its life, a sleek
white rat, and behind it, in close pursuit, a bouncing cat. &ldquo;Save
my rat! oh, save my white rat!&rdquo; cried the maiden&rsquo;s voice;
and her steps approached as if she would have run into the room after
her pet. &ldquo;Keep back, child! keep back! Enter not, for your
life!&rdquo; cried the magician, sternly; and nothing more was heard
but the gentle maiden&rsquo;s sobs.</p>
<p>Quick as thought, however, Eligio had started from his despondent
attitude at the sound of her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href=
"#pb364" name="pb364">364</a>]</span>distressful voice, and with one
blow had stamped the life out of the treacherous cat. The little white
rat, freed from fear of its tormentor, returned softly to its mistress,
and an exclamation of joy was Eligio&rsquo;s reward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who have you got there, father? Mayn&rsquo;t I come in and
thank him?&rdquo; said the maiden, prettily pleading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On no account. Don&rsquo;t think of it!&rdquo; was the
magician&rsquo;s angry reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must do something for him instead. Ask him what he
wants, and do it for him, <i>whatever</i> it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, that&rsquo;ll do; go back to your own
apartment,&rdquo; replied the magician, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it won&rsquo;t do, like that. You don&rsquo;t say it as
if you meant it. Promise me you will give him something nice, and I
will go. It&rsquo;s only fair, for he has done me a great pleasure, and
you mustn&rsquo;t be ungrateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is enough reward, fair maiden, to hear from your sweet
voice that you are satisfied with me,&rdquo; Eligio ventured to say;
but this made the magician more angry, and, to ensure his
daughter&rsquo;s departure, he promised he would do as she wished, but
forbade either of them to speak a single word more to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have promised my daughter to give you a good gift,&rdquo;
he said, when he had satisfied himself <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb365" href="#pb365" name="pb365">365</a>]</span>that she was gone to
a distance; &ldquo;and under present circumstances I do not see that I
can give you a better boon than to grant you a year of the life which
you have lost to me. Go home and bid adieu to your friends, and be sure
that you are back here by this day year, or woe be to your whole
house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eligio now began to suspect that he had fallen into the power of one
of those against whom he had been often warned. No ordinary mortal
could have cared to win his life; no ordinary mortal could have
threatened woe on his whole house. But the more convinced he felt of
this, the more terrible he felt was the spell that bound him.</p>
<p>Sad and crestfallen he looked as he toiled his way back to the
castle on the Lago di Molveno, and very different from the brave order
with which he had started.</p>
<p>When his parents saw him all alone, and looking so forlorn, they
knew that his bad habit had got him into trouble, but he looked so sad
that they said nothing; but by little and little he told them all. It
was a year of mourning that succeeded that day; a year so sad that it
seemed no boon the maiden had procured him, but a prolonged torment,
yet when that thought came he spurned it from him, as ungrateful to her
who had meant him well. In fact his only solace was to recall that
clear, ringing voice so full of sympathy, and to picture to himself the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name=
"pb366">366</a>]</span>slender throat and rosy lips through which it
must have passed, the softly-blushing cheeks between which those lips
must have been set, and the bright, laughing, trusting eyes that must
have beamed over them, till he seemed quite to know and love her.</p>
<p>But then, again, of what use? was not his year nearly run out? Was
not her father determined they should not meet? Was it not a greater
torture to die knowing there was one left behind he might have loved,
than to have died that night alone, as he had been then?</p>
<p>Meantime the year was drawing to a close, and, not to give an
appearance of shrinking from his plighted word, Eligio started betimes
to render his life up to him who had won it of him. It was a sad
parting with his parents, but he held up through it bravely; and when
they advised him to take a large sum of money with him to buy himself
off, though he felt it would be of no use, he would not say them nay,
as he had so often done before.</p>
<p>With a heavy heart he set out; and first he stopped at the chapel of
St. Anthony, at the foot of the hill, where dwelt an old hermit, to
make his peace with heaven before he was called to lay down his life.
Then he rose and pursued his way.</p>
<p>As he journeyed farther he met a hermit coming towards him who he
thought was the same he had spoken with in the chapel. &ldquo;Tell me,
father,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how comes it that you, whom I left
behind <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name=
"pb367">367</a>]</span>me in the chapel, are now coming towards me on
the road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not the hermit whom you left behind you in the
chapel,&rdquo; replied the advancing figure, gravely. &ldquo;But I have
heard all you confided to him, for I am St. Anthony; and because I am
satisfied with the good disposition I have observed in you, I am come
to give you help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eligio fell on his knees full of thankfulness, for never had he felt
more in need of help than now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something I know, my son, of the ways of these men who hunt
the lambs of our flock to destroy them, and I am minded to save you
from the one into whose power you have fallen, and with you the fair
maiden whose voice charmed you in his house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eligio started with joyful surprise, and clasped the saint&rsquo;s
feet in token of gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is not his daughter, as you have supposed,&rdquo;
continued the saint, &ldquo;but a child of our people, whom he stole
from us. And now you must attend to my bidding, and do it exactly, or
you will fail, and lose her life as well as your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eligio felt the reproach, for he knew how often he had preferred his
own way to the advice of his elders, but he was humble now in his
distress, and listened very attentively to the directions prescribed to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Continue this public road towards the city,&rdquo; then said
St. Anthony, &ldquo;till you get to the last <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368" name=
"pb368">368</a>]</span>milestone; then count the tenth tree that you
pass on the right hand and the eleventh on the left hand, and you will
see a scarcely perceptible track through the brake to the right. Follow
that track till you come to a knoll of ilex-trees, there lie down and
rest; but to-morrow morning awake at daybreak and lie in wait, and you
shall see a flock of white doves come before you. They will lay aside
their feathers and hide them, but you must watch them very closely, for
they are the magician&rsquo;s daughters; but among them will be she
whom I commission you to deliver. You must observe where she puts her
feathers, for the maidens will all then go away for the rest of the day
in their own natural form. As soon as they are gone, take her feathers
from their hiding-place and possess yourself of them. In the evening
they will all come back and resume their dove form and fly away, but
your maiden will continue seeking hers; then come forward and tell her
that you want her help to overcome the sorceries of the magician.
Remember this well, my son, and for the rest do as she bids you.&rdquo;
So saying, the saint raised his hands in blessing, and passed on his
way to the chapel, where he had to instruct the hermit in the conduct
he had to pursue in the manifold dangers with which he was surrounded
from the malice of the heathen.</p>
<p>Eligio walked briskly along, once more filled with the hope and
energy incident to his youth and character. &ldquo;Why should I count
the trees?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369"
name="pb369">369</a>]</span>he said to himself; &ldquo;surely, it will
do if I look out for the track when I come to the brake!&rdquo; But the
terrible warning he had had was too recent that he should forget its
lessons already. &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s better to keep to the
letter. The saint laid great stress on my doing exactly as he bid me;
it is better to be on the safe side, for another worthier life than
mine is concerned with me, this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he walked on steadily till he came to the last mile, and then
counted the trees conscientiously, till he found the path through the
brake, and made his way to the ilex grove, where he laid him down and
slept peacefully. But long before daybreak he was awake with the
anxiety not to be behindhand, and closely he watched for the arrival of
the enchanted doves.</p>
<p>With the first streaks of daylight they came flying, as the saint
had predicted, and, having flung off their covering of white feathers,
each sought out a snug place under the heather where to deposit them.
It required close watching, indeed, to make out which was <i>his</i>
maiden; but, as they all chatted together, after the manner of maidens,
Eligio knew he could trust himself to recognize her voice, and, guided
by that, he kept his eyes hard fixed on her whose tones he recognized,
that he might be sure to distinguish where she laid by her disguise. It
was not light enough to satisfy himself whether her <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href="#pb370" name=
"pb370">370</a>]</span>features corresponded with the idea he had built
up in his own mind; but the grace of her form, as she passed by in her
simple white, loosely-flowing dress, with a chaplet of roses for her
only ornament; only made him the more anxious to behold her face.</p>
<p>The maidens walked away, and Eligio took possession of the feathery
covering, which he laid up in his bosom as a precious token, and took
it out again and gazed at it, and kissed it, and laid it by again a
thousand times, for it was his only solace through the long day of
waiting.</p>
<p>At last evening came, and he resumed his post of observation. The
maidens returned; each sought out and resumed her dove&rsquo;s feathers
and flew away; only the one was left, seeking hers in vain. Then Eligio
came forward, and said, respectfully, &ldquo;Fair lady, I know what it
is you seek, and I will help you to find it; but first promise to do me
a great favour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maiden started, for she too recognized his voice. Their eyes
met, and both owned, in the depth of their own hearts, that the other
bore the very image which for a year past their fancy had conjured
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will I, willingly, good sir!&rdquo; she replied, in her
sweetest tones; &ldquo;for, an&rsquo; I mistake not, I owe you a debt
of gratitude before to-day. The treacherous cat that you killed so
opportunely was no cat, but a cruel Angana<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5639src" href="#xd21e5639" name="xd21e5639src">90</a>; and the
white <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb371" href="#pb371" name=
"pb371">371</a>]</span>rat concerned me so nearly, because it was no
rat, but my dear nurse, whom the magician turned into a rat when he
stole me from my father&rsquo;s house. So believe if I was not anxious
to save her, and if I ought not to be grateful to him who preserved her
to me! so tell me, what can I do to help you, and, whatever it may be,
I will do it to the utmost of my power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;St. Anthony appeared to me as I came along this way,&rdquo;
rejoined Eligio, &ldquo;and he told me that you had been stolen from
Christian parents and brought up by this heathen mage, and that you
would help me to get out of his power; but he also seemed to say that I
should have the happiness of helping you to leave this dreadful abode,
and restoring you to Christendom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Said he so?&rdquo; answered the maiden, with intense
earnestness; &ldquo;then my heart did not deceive me when I first heard
your voice: you are indeed he with the thread of whose life mine is
woven, and without whom I could not be set free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Eligio heard that, he was full of gladness, and he said,
&ldquo;Let us escape, then! What should prevent us from leaving this
country together? When I saw the magician before, the laws of
hospitality made him sacred to my sword; but now&mdash;now that I have
learnt I have a right to defend <i>your</i> life&mdash;I defy him, and
all his arts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are brave, I see; and it is well,&rdquo; she replied;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href="#pb372" name=
"pb372">372</a>]</span>&ldquo;but it is not so you can discard his
power. By your own error you gave him power over you, and now you are
his; you can only be free by his will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By his will!&rdquo; cried Eligio, in despair; &ldquo;then
shall I never be free!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Art must be met by art,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;His art
is all round you, though you see not its meshes; and by art we must
bring him to renounce his claim on you. Trust me, and I will show you
how it is to be done. He would force me to learn his arts when I begged
him not, and now I know many things which will serve us. I can see the
threads of his toils woven all around you; you cannot escape from them
till he speaks you free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, then, what I must do,&rdquo; said Eligio; and he
mentally resolved as he spoke, that he would this time implicitly obey
what she told him.</p>
<p>She remained thinking for a time, as if reckoning out a problem.
Then she said, &ldquo;For this first time I must act. On the fatal day
you must present yourself according to your oath. I will take care to
be with him when they tell him you are come; and when I hear your name,
I will plead, as I did before, that he should not sacrifice you at
once, but give you some hard trial in which, if you succeed, he shall
speak you free. To silence my importunity, he will agree to this,
intending to give you so hard a trial that you should not succeed. But
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373" name=
"pb373">373</a>]</span>you come to me in my bower, cooing three times
like a dove, for a signal, at this same evening hour, and tell me what
it is, and I will find the means in my books to carry you through the
trial. So that, whatever he proposes to you, be not disconcerted, but
accept and undertake it with a good heart. And now, give me my
dove&rsquo;s feathers quickly, for already they will be questioning why
I am so long behind.&rdquo; And without waiting to let him take so much
as another gaze at her, she assumed her dove shape, and flew away.</p>
<p>The next day Eligio went, with a lighter heart than he had borne for
a long time past, to give himself up to the magician. The magician, won
over by the maiden&rsquo;s importunity, offered him his liberty on
condition of his performing successfully the difficult feat that he
should impose on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any thing you please to impose on me, I am ready to
perform,&rdquo; replied Eligio.</p>
<p>The magician smiled, with a ghastly, sardonic smile, while he
paused, and tried to think of the most terrible trial he could
impose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you were here last,&rdquo; he said, at length, &ldquo;I
have grown a little deaf, and I am told that the only cure there is for
me is the singing of the ph&oelig;nix-bird. The first thing you have to
do is to find me the ph&oelig;nix-bird, that its singing may heal
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do my best; and hope I may be the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name=
"pb374">374</a>]</span>means of curing your malady,&rdquo; said Eligio,
courteously; but the magician, seeing him of such good courage, began
to fear he really might succeed, and added, hastily, &ldquo;But, mind,
I only allow you three days for your search!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three days are but little to find the
ph&oelig;nix-bird,&rdquo; replied Eligio; &ldquo;nevertheless, I will
do my best;&rdquo; and without waiting to listen to any further
restrictions, he started on his way, saying, &ldquo;If I have only
three days, I have no time to lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the approach of the evening hour Eligio found his way to his
maiden&rsquo;s bower, and having attracted her attention by cooing
three times like a dove, told her what was the trial the magician had
imposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ph&oelig;nix-bird!&rdquo; she said, and she looked rather
blank; &ldquo;he has chosen a difficult task indeed. But wait a bit; I
think I can find it out;&rdquo; and she went back and took down scroll
after scroll, and turned them over so long, that Eligio began to fear
that she would not be able to help him after all. At last she came back
to him, looking grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is more difficult even than I thought,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;and three days is but short time to do it in. You must start
this night, without losing a minute. Set out by the stony path outside
the town, and ride ahead till you come to a forest, where a bear will
come out upon you. The moment you see him, spring from your horse, and
cut its throat with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375"
name="pb375">375</a>]</span>your hunting-knife; but if you hesitate a
moment he will fall upon you, and devour you. If, however, you kill
your horse dexterously, as you will, the bear will be satisfied with
its flesh. You must wait standing by till he has eaten his fill, and
watch for the moment when he is about to turn away again, then spring
on his back, and he will take you to the castle where the
ph&oelig;nix-bird is kept; but if you lose that particular moment, he
will return to his cave, and you will never have a chance of reaching
the ph&oelig;nix-bird!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rely on me; your directions shall be punctually
obeyed,&rdquo; said Eligio, and he stooped to kiss her hand. But she
would not allow this, and told him he had not an instant to spare.</p>
<p>Eligio mounted his horse, and rode away over the stony path outside
the city, and pursued it all night, till at daybreak he reached the
thick forest, when a bear came out upon him; Eligio sprang deftly from
his horse, and plunging his hunting-knife into his throat, flung the
carcase across the path. The bear fell upon the dead horse, and Eligio
watched for the moment when he should have finished his repast; but, as
he was long about it, he thought to himself, &ldquo;Why not jump upon
him at once? and then I shall be ready to start with him when he has
done, without so much anxiety about catching the right instant.&rdquo;
So said, so done; but the bear was not at all the docile animal he had
expected. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb376" href="#pb376" name=
"pb376">376</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t disturb me when I&rsquo;m feeding!&rdquo; he
growled, and shook our hero off into a bed of nettles.</p>
<p>Eligio owned to himself he would have done better to follow the
directions of those wiser than he, and waited, with as much patience as
the stinging of the nettles would allow him, till the brute was ready
to start, and then made a bold leap on to his back, which made him turn
round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well sprung, this time!&rdquo; growled the bear; &ldquo;and
as you have managed that part of the business so well I have no
objection to do what you require. But you must attend to what I have to
tell you. Keep your seat steadily, for I have to go swiftly; but speak
not a word, and when I bring you to the palace where the
ph&oelig;nix-bird is kept, look not to the right hand or the left, but
walk straight before you, through terrace, and galleries, and
corridors, till you come to a dismal, deserted-looking aviary, where
the ph&oelig;nix-bird evermore sits on his perch. Put this hood over
him, and bring him away with you; but listen not to the songs of the
other birds all around, and, above all, touch not the golden owl which
sits in the shade above!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eligio promised to attend to all the bear told him, and took a firm
seat on his back. The bear bounded away with an awkward gait, but
Eligio was an accomplished cavalier, and was nothing daunted. After
many hours&rsquo; rough riding, they came to a vast palace, which he
understood by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href="#pb377"
name="pb377">377</a>]</span>bear&rsquo;s halting was the abode of the
ph&oelig;nix-bird; so he dismounted, and walked straight along the
terraces, and galleries, and corridors, till he came to a sorry aviary
where a thousand birds of gay plumage fluttered and chirped around.
Faithful to his promise, Eligio stopped to look at none of them; but
walked straight up to the perch of the ph&oelig;nix-bird. When,
however, he saw him, he began to reason in place of obeying.
&ldquo;What can be the use of taking a shabby old bird like that? he
looks like a fowl plucked ready for cooking! surely, some of these
gay-plumaged birds are better worth taking!&rdquo; and then his eye
caught the golden owl snugly ensconced in the shady bower above.
&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s a bird worth having, <i>that</i> is now!
that&rsquo;s worth coming a perilous journey for; something to be proud
of when you&rsquo;ve got it! That&rsquo;s the bird for me!&rdquo; and,
springing upon a ledge of rock, he threw the hood the bear had given
him over the head of the golden owl, and brought it down. He had
scarcely touched the golden owl, however, when the whole assemblage of
other birds, which had taken no notice of him before, suddenly began
screeching forth their highest notes. Their cries brought a crowd of
servants, who surrounded him and held him fast, while the lord of the
palace came down, and severely asked an account of his conduct.</p>
<p>Eligio told his story with a frankness which, in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href="#pb378" name="pb378">378</a>]</span>some
measure, conciliated the old lord; but the offence was too great to be
passed over. &ldquo;The ph&oelig;nix-bird,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;might
have been taken by him who had courage to take it after the prescribed
manner; but the other birds it was sacrilege to meddle with, and the
golden owl he had been expressly forbidden, of all others, to touch;
and though he granted him his life, he condemned him to perpetual
durance.&rdquo; The servants dragged him off to a deep dungeon, where
he had nothing to do but to bewail his folly.</p>
<p>Night fell around, and nothing could be more hopeless than his
position. His cell was hewn out of the earth; the iron door through
which he had been thrust had been made fast with bolts and chains, and
the only window which admitted the free air was strongly fitted with
iron bars.</p>
<p>Eligio was generous enough, in his utter desolation, to grieve more
over his unfulfilled mission and wasted opportunities, than over his
personal hardships. &ldquo;Oh, my beautiful Dove-Maiden!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, &ldquo;shall I, then, never see you again? Must you be left
for aye to the power of the horrid pagan enchanter, because I, by my
insensate folly, have failed in restoring you to the brightness of the
Christian faith?&rdquo; and when he thought of her fate, he wept
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;St Anthony! St. Anthony!&rdquo; he cried, a little after,
&ldquo;you befriended me once; give me one <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379" name=
"pb379">379</a>]</span>chance again! This once but send me forth again
with the mission of liberating <i>her</i>, and then let me come back
and pass my life in penance; but let not her suffer through my
fault!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By a mechanical instinct he had placed himself near the window, as
the type of freedom to him, and now he thought he heard a low grunt on
the other side of it, close to his ear. The sound was not melodious,
but yet he fancied there was something friendly in its tone. He raised
himself up, and saw two white boar&rsquo;s tusks between the bars. His
solitude was so utter that even the visit of a wild boar was a solace
of companionship; but much greater was his pleasure when he found that
his uncouth visitor was grubbing up the earth round the iron bars and
the stones which held them, and had already loosened one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How now, good boar!&rdquo; cried Eligio; &ldquo;are you
really come to release me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the boar, as he paused for a moment to take
breath; &ldquo;St. Anthony has heard you, and has sent me to give the
fresh chance you ask for; and if you this time but keep your promise,
and do as you are bid, he will not exact the performance of the
lifelong penance you offer to perform; but after you have released the
Dove-Maiden, you shall live with her the rest of your life in holy
union and companionship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a transport of delight Eligio set to work to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href="#pb380" name=
"pb380">380</a>]</span>co-operate with the boar in unearthing the
massive stanchions; and when they had loosened three he was able to
force himself through the narrow opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now return to the aviary,&rdquo; said the boar; &ldquo;look
neither to right nor left, but bring away the ph&oelig;nix-bird; and
speak not a word, but mount on my back, and I will carry you back to
the city. But make all haste, or the three days will have expired, and
then all will be lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time Eligio followed his instructions implicitly, and got back
to the town just in time to present the magician with the
ph&oelig;nix-bird before the expiring of his three days&rsquo; grace.
The magician was surprised indeed to find he had been successful, but
could not recall his word, so he was forced to pronounce him free; and
Eligio immediately repaired to the Dove-Maiden to thank her for her
succour, and to ask what was next to be done to set her free too, that
they might go away together to Christian lands, and live for each other
in holy union.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for me,&rdquo; replied the maiden, blushing, &ldquo;I
shall be free by virtue of your freedom when you have performed one
trial well, and without altering according to your own ideas the
directions prescribed for you. And now the first thing is, to obtain
the release of my dear nurse from the horrid form in which the magician
has disguised her. To <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href=
"#pb381" name="pb381">381</a>]</span>keep her in that shape, she is
forced to eat a live mouse every week; and as nothing else is given her
that she can eat, and as she is very ravenous by the time the week
comes round, she is forced to eat the mouse. But if the mouse be killed
by a sword consecrated to Christian chivalry, and it is dead before she
eats it, the spell will be broken, and she will resume her natural
form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eligio said this was an easy matter. She had only to tell him on
what day the feeding took place, and where.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has its difficulties, too,&rdquo; replied the Dove-Maiden;
&ldquo;for if any blood of the mouse be spilt, the magician will know
that I have instructed you, and he will play us some bad turn. To
prevent this, you must cut the mouse in two by drawing your sword
towards you; then all the blood will be caught on the sword, and you
must make the rat lick it off afterwards.&rdquo; Then she showed him
where the mouse was brought, and told him to be on the watch at sunset
that very night.</p>
<p>Sunset accordingly found Eligio in close watch, his sword ready in
his hand. But he thought, &ldquo;As for how to use a sword, my pretty
Dove-Maiden knows nothing about that. Who ever heard of drawing a sword
towards one? Why, if any one saw me they would laugh, and say,
&lsquo;Take care of your legs!&rsquo; I know how to cut a mouse in two
so quickly that no blood shall be spilt; and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb382" href="#pb382" name=
"pb382">382</a>]</span>that&rsquo;s all that matters.&rdquo; So, you
see, he would do it his own way; and the consequence was that three
drops of blood were spilt on the ground However, the white rat got a
dead mouse to eat instead of a live one, and immediately appeared in
her proper woman&rsquo;s form.</p>
<p>When Eligio went to visit the Dove-Maiden after this, she spoke no
word of reproach, but she told him she knew some trouble would befall
them in consequence of those three drops of blood. She could not tell
what it would be: they must do their best to provide against it when
the time came. The next thing he had to do was, to go by midnight to
the magician&rsquo;s stables under the rock, and take out thence the
swiftest horse in the whole world, and he was to know it by the token
that it was the thinnest horse he ever saw; its eyeballs and its ribs
were all that could be seen of it; and its tail was only one hair! This
he was to saddle and bring under her window; and then all three would
ride away on it together.</p>
<p>Eligio went down into the magician&rsquo;s stable under the rock by
midnight, and there he saw the lean horse, with his protruding ribs and
eyeballs, and whose tail was only one hair. But he said to himself,
&ldquo;My pretty Dove-Maiden hasn&rsquo;t much experience in
horseflesh; <i>that</i> can&rsquo;t be the swiftest horse in the world.
Why, it would sink to the ground with our weight alone, let alone
trying to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href="#pb383" name=
"pb383">383</a>]</span>move under us! That high-couraged chestnut
there, with the powerful shoulders&mdash;<i>that</i> is the horse to
hold out against fatigue, and put miles of distance behind you! I think
I know a good horse to go when I see one!&rdquo; So he saddled the
high-couraged chestnut, and led it under the Dove-Maiden&rsquo;s
window.</p>
<p>When she saw the stout chestnut instead of the lean horse, she could
not suppress a cry of disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You have left the
swiftest horse in the world behind; and now the magician can overtake
us, nor can we escape him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eligio hung his head, and stammered out a proposal to go and change
the horse. But she told him it was too late; the stable-door was only
open at midnight. He could not now get in till the next night; and if
they left their escape till then, the magician would find out the
disenchantment of the white rat, and from that suspect their scheme;
and would then surround them with such a maze of difficulties, that it
would take her years to learn how to solve them; whereas she had
promised St. Anthony to have nothing more to do with the books of
magic, but to burn them all, and go and live with a Christian husband,
far from all these things. There was nothing to be done, therefore, but
to start at once with their best speed, only keeping on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href="#pb384" name="pb384">384</a>]</span>the
watch for the pursuer, who would inevitably come.</p>
<p>Away went the high-couraged chestnut, with the speed of the wind,
and as if his threefold burden had been light as air. But how swiftly
soever he went, the lean horse was swifter; and before the end of the
second day&rsquo;s journey they saw, at no distance, his fire-darting
eyeballs and smoking ribs, and his tail of one hair stretched out far
behind.</p>
<p>When the Dove-Maiden saw the magician coming after them on this
weird mount, she called to her companions to jump down; and she turned
the horse into a wayside chapel of St. Anthony, and herself into a
peasant girl weaving chaplets on the grass outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen a chestnut steed pass this way, with a young
man and maiden, pretty child?&rdquo; said the magician, bending low
over his horse&rsquo;s neck to pat the peasant girl&rsquo;s cheek, but
without recognizing her. The Dove-Maiden started aside from his touch;
but she answered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, good sir; they are gone into the chapel; and if you will
go in, there you will find them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ve got into the land of the Christians, have
I?&rdquo; said the magician to himself. &ldquo;I think I had better
make the best of my way home, and not trust myself there.&rdquo; So he
mounted his fiery steed, and rode away.</p>
<p>Then the Dove-Maiden restored herself and her <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb385" href="#pb385" name=
"pb385">385</a>]</span>companions to their former shapes, and they soon
reached home, where Eligio was received with joyful acclamations by
all. But to his intense surprise and disappointment, his mother did not
welcome his beautiful Dove-Maiden with any thing like satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is because of the three drops of the mouse&rsquo;s blood
incautiously spilt,&rdquo; she whispered, when he deplored it to her;
&ldquo;but I have a spell against that also. Let me into your
mother&rsquo;s room when she is asleep, to-night, and I will anoint her
eyes with an ointment with shall make her look on me for ever after
with a loving glance. It was done as she said, and next morning
Eligio&rsquo;s mother received her lovingly to her arms as a
daughter.</p>
<p>After this, the Dove-Maiden burnt her magic books, and her nuptials
with Eligio were celebrated with great rejoicings throughout the
valley. They lived together for the rest of their days, in holy union,
and the poor Christians of the whole countryside blessed their charity.

<h3 class="main">KRISELDA.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long, long ago, in the days when the light of
Christian teaching yet struggled with the gloom of heathendom, there
lived in the Edelsitz of Ruggburg, by Bregenz, a most beautiful
maiden&mdash;Kriselda by name. So fair she was that, from far and near,
knights and nobles came to ask her hand; but though she was not proud
or haughty, she would have none of them, because there was not one of
them all that came up to her expectations. It was not that she said
they were not good enough for her, but high or noble, or rich or
renowned, as they might be, they all failed to satisfy her longings;
and with gentle words and courteous demeanour, she dismissed them all.
And yet she looked out with hope, too, that the next should supply the
bright ideal of her heart; but when that other came he always still
fell short of what she had imagined.</p>
<p>One evening she went out to walk amid the dark <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387" name=
"pb387">387</a>]</span>pines, where the golden light of the setting sun
gleamed between their bare stems. At the foot of one of them lay a poor
wayworn beggar woman, fainting with hunger and fatigue.</p>
<p>Kriselda was full of compassion for her sad state, and sent her
maidens to fetch restoratives, and ministered them to her with her own
hands.</p>
<p>But the beggar woman, instead of cringing with gratitude and
surprise at the interest the noble lady had shown in her, was no sooner
able to speak than she reproached her bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well for you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;who live
daintily, and have your will every day, now and then to show a little
charity for those who suffer! but what is it, think you, to suffer
every day, and to have your own will <i>never</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be very sad!&rdquo; said Kriselda, compassionately;
&ldquo;that is not your case, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you know it is sad? How can you hope any thing about
it?&rdquo; retorted the beggar woman, sternly; &ldquo;you who know not
what it is to suffer. Believe me, it is not fine clothes and a grand
palace, a beautiful face, or deeds of fame which make one great. Those
to whom all these things appertain are, for the most part, little
worth. To do well is so easy to them, that what merit have they to
boast? The truly great is one who suffers, and <i>yet</i> does well;
who goes through toil and travail, sorrow and grief, and bears it in
silence, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388" name=
"pb388">388</a>]</span>and in secret, and has no fame and no praise of
men to sound sweetly in his ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kriselda listened to her words full of excitement, for it seemed as
if a chord in her heart had been touched which none had ever reached
before. And the picture the old beggar woman had drawn was nearer her
mind&rsquo;s bright ideal than any image she had approached
heretofore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, then, is this same travail and grief?&rdquo; she asked,
with simplicity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you really desire to know with good desire,&rdquo;
answered the beggar woman, &ldquo;take this end of a hank of yarn, and
follow its leading, winding it up as you go along, till you come to the
bobbin, where it is made fast; and when you arrive there you will know
what travail and grief are. But you must go forth alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kriselda dismissed all her maidens, and taking the yarn, cheerfully
followed the steep path through which it led. On it led her, and on and
on. Her light garments were rent by the thorns and briars, and her
hands and delicate cheeks too; her feet were cut by the stones of the
way, and her knees began to tremble with fatigue. Darkness fell around,
and loneliness crept over her, with fear, for she had never been in the
forest by night alone before; but still the yarn led on, and on, and it
was thick night before she reached the bobbin, where it was made
fast.</p>
<p>When she reached the place a dim light gleamed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb389" href="#pb389" name=
"pb389">389</a>]</span>around, and in the midst of the dim light a
Kreuzst&ouml;cklein<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5831src" href=
"#xd21e5831" name="xd21e5831src">91</a>: and on the cross, One fairer
than the sons of men, but wan and wayworn, even as the fainting beggar
woman; His brow rent by thorns, even as her own; His knees bent with
weariness; His body wasted by want.</p>
<p>But in His face the majesty and sweetness she had sought so long;
the perfect ideal of her heart, which none who had approached her had
ever presented before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, then, is He for whom my soul longed!&rdquo; she cried,
and clasped her hands. &ldquo;I have found Him, and will not leave Him
more! But who is He? what does He here? and is it He who knows travail
and grief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In truth, have I known travail and grief!&rdquo; He sighed,
and the silvery tones of His plaintive voice filled her with
unutterable joy; &ldquo;and, in truth, must all those who would abide
with Me know travail and grief too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She strained her ears that she might hear those sweet notes again,
but she listened in vain; only its echoes seemed to live on in her
heart, as though they would never die there. But without, there was no
sound, save of the terrible F&ouml;hn<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5842src" href="#xd21e5842" name="xd21e5842src">92</a> moaning
through <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href="#pb390" name=
"pb390">390</a>]</span>the tall black pines, and drifting round her
masses of heaped-up snow, which had long lain by the wayside. Even the
Kreuzst&ouml;cklein she saw no more, nor the dim light, nor knew how to
find the way home. All alone, with terror only for her companion, she
stood and wondered what that cross could mean, and who He could be who
hung thereon. Soon she ceased to wonder, for numbness crept over her,
and unconsciousness which was not sleep.</p>
<p>When she opened her eyes again the grey light of morning had fallen
around, and there was a sound as of men in deadly combat. A terrible
sound, yet less terrible than the deathly stillness of the night.</p>
<p>It was a hermit and a giant who strove, as men who give no quarter,
and yet neither prevailed against the other. The giant was accoutred in
burnished steel; and his polished weapons flashed with angry fire. The
hermit bore no arms&mdash;or rather, those he bore were invisible, for
when he wielded them you saw the giant shrink, though you saw not the
blow; and, in like manner, many a stroke of the giant&rsquo;s sword was
harmlessly warded off, though no shield was seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore fight you so furiously?&rdquo; said Kriselda, at
length. &ldquo;Put up your arms, and be at peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We fight for you, fair maiden!&rdquo; said both, speaking
together. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href="#pb391" name=
"pb391">391</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;For me!&rdquo; cried Kriselda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, even for you,&rdquo; said the giant; &ldquo;anon you
were lying here asleep, and I would have carried you to rule over my
castle, when up started this puny man in brown, and dared me to lay
finger on you; and till you have pronounced which of us you approve,
neither can prevail. Say only one word, and I will hurl him down the
cliff, like this pebble, with one spurning of my foot; and you shall
come and reign with me in my castle, where I will fulfil your every
desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A brave enthusiasm kindled his eye as he spoke; his well-knit frame,
terrible in its strength, was bowed to hear her word; and his arms,
anon so furiously raised, were now folded before her, seemingly
awaiting his life to be rekindled at her lips.</p>
<p>Kriselda looked at him, and met his rapt gaze, and asked herself was
there not here the strength, the majesty, the nobility, her soul had
desired. Almost she had spoken the word he craved. But first she
addressed the hermit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;why measured you your strength with him for my
sake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said the hermit, meekly, &ldquo;I am the
servant of Him who knows travail and grief; because you have lifted up
your eyes to Him, and to all such He sends help, that they may be
strengthened to follow Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the dim light seemed once more present <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392" name="pb392">392</a>]</span>to
Kriselda&rsquo;s mind, and she recalled the Kreuzst&ouml;cklein, and
the majesty and beauty of Him who hung thereon; and the musical tones
of His plaintive voice which said, &ldquo;Truly I have known travail
and grief; and all they who would abide with Me must know grief and
travail too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The giant&rsquo;s nobility paled before the thought; she looked at
him again, and his strength and his power had lost their charm, for the
image of One stronger than he was present to her mind. Then she turned
and followed the hermit, and said, &ldquo;Where is He whom I seek? Take
me to Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hermit raised his hand and beckoned her to follow still higher
up the steep path.</p>
<p>But the giant was forced to sheathe his sword and to depart alone;
Kriselda had spoken, and he knew he could not prevail against the
hermit contrary to her will. He turned away sorrowful, casting in his
mind who it could be whose attractions were more powerful on Kriselda
than his own; and as he walked he determined he would not sleep or eat
till he had found out Him who hung upon the Kreuzst&ouml;cklein, and
knew travail and grief.</p>
<p>Kriselda, meantime, followed the hermit to where the crystal brook
flowed, and there he signed her with the token of Him who knew travail
and grief. Then he took her to where other maidens dwelt who loved that
same ideal; and there she lived many years, waiting for the time when
the hermit <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href="#pb393" name=
"pb393">393</a>]</span>promised her she should be united with Him for
ever.</p>
<p>That day came at last; and she called her sisters round her, and
told them the joy of her soul. Already she saw a dim light, as on that
first night under the black pines, and she knew it was the dawn of the
bright unending day, and the soft voice that had spoken to her there
was calling to her to come to Him.</p>
<p>But when they carried her earthly form out to burial, they found one
already lying in the grave. It was the giant, who had journeyed thus
far, and had there laid him down and died in the place where Kriselda
should be laid; and he held, clasped to his breast, the
Kreuzst&ouml;cklein of the black pine-forest. <span class=

<h3 class="main">THE GOLDEN PEARS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a poor peasant of B&uuml;rs who had
nothing in the world but three sons, and a pear-tree that grew before
his cottage.</p>
<p>But as his pears were very fine, and the Kaiser was very fond of
them, he said to his sons one day, that he would send the Kaiser a
basket of them for a present.</p>
<p>So he plaited a nice Krattle<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5898src"
href="#xd21e5898" name="xd21e5898src">93</a> and lined it with fresh
leaves, and laid the pears on them, and sent his eldest son with it to
make a present to the Kaiser, giving him strict charge to take care and
not let any one rob him of them by the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me alone, father!&rdquo; replied the boy; &ldquo;I know
how to take care of my own. It isn&rsquo;t much any one will get out of
me by asking; I can find as good an answer as any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he closed up the mouth of the basket with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href="#pb395" name=
"pb395">395</a>]</span>fresh leaves and went out to take the pears to
the Kaiser.</p>
<p>It was autumn, and the sun struck hot all through the midday hours,
and at last coming to a wayside fountain, he sat down to drink and
rest.</p>
<p>A little doubled-up old woman was washing some rags at the same
fountain, and singing a ditty all out of tune. &ldquo;A witch,
I&rsquo;ll be bound!&rdquo; said the boy to himself.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be trying to get my pears, by hook or by crook, but
I&rsquo;ll be even with her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fair day, my lad!&rdquo; said the little old wife;
&ldquo;but a heavy burden you have to carry. What may it be with which
you are so heavily laden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A load of sweepings off the road, to see if I can turn a
penny by it,&rdquo; replied the boy, in a moody tone, intended to
arrest further questioning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Road-sweepings?&rdquo; repeated the hag, incredulously.
&ldquo;Belike you don&rsquo;t mean it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I <i>do</i> mean it,&rdquo; retorted the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, if you mean it, no doubt it is so. You will see
when you get to your journey&rsquo;s end!&rdquo; and she went on
washing and singing her ditty that was all out of tune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s mischief in her tone,&rdquo; said the boy to
himself, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s clear. But at all events I&rsquo;m all
right: I haven&rsquo;t even let her look at the fruit with her evil
eye, so there&rsquo;s no harm done.&rdquo; But he felt perplexed and
uneasy, so it was no good taking rest, and he went on to the end of his
journey. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb396" href="#pb396" name=
"pb396">396</a>]</span></p>
<p>Though he was only a country lad, the Kaiser was so fond of pears
that he had only to say he had brought some to obtain immediate
admittance to his presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have brought me some pears, have you, my boy?&rdquo; said
the Kaiser, in a tone of satisfaction; and he licked his lips with
pleasurable expectation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your majesty; and some of the finest golden pears in
your majesty&rsquo;s whole empire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Kaiser was so delighted to hear this that he removed the
covering of leaves himself. But proportionately great was his fury when
he found that under the leaves was nothing but offensive sweepings off
the road! The attendants who stood by were all equally indignant, and
waited not for an order from the Kaiser to carry the boy off to close
prison, in punishment for so great an insult as he appeared to have
offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all that old hag by the fountain,&rdquo; he said to
himself, the first day and the second; but when the penitential
discipline of the prison led him to think more closely over his own
conduct, he acknowledged that he had himself been in the wrong in
telling a falsehood.</p>
<p>Meantime, his father, finding he did not return, said to his other
sons, &ldquo;You see what it is to be as wide-awake as your elder
brother; he has obviously taken care of his basket of golden pears, and
so pleased the Kaiser that he has given him some <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397" name=
"pb397">397</a>]</span>great office near his person, and made him a
rich man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am just as sharp as he,&rdquo; said the second brother:
&ldquo;give me a Krattle of the pears, and let me take them to the
Kaiser, and become a rich man too; only I won&rsquo;t keep it all for
myself. I will send for you, and make you a rich man too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well said, my son,&rdquo; replied the father; &ldquo;for I
have worked hard for you all my life, and it is meet that in my old age
you should share your ease, which I helped you to attain, with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as the season for pears had just come round again, he plaited
another Krattle, like the first, and lined it with fresh leaves, and
laid in it a goodly show of the golden pears.</p>
<p>The second son took the basket, and went his way even in better
spirits than his elder brother, for he had the conviction of his
success to encourage him. But the sun was as hot as it had been the
previous year, and when, in the middle of the third day, he came to the
fountain by the wayside he was glad to sit down to rest and refresh
himself.</p>
<p>The doubled-up old woman stood washing her rags at the fountain and
singing her ditty all out of tune. She stopped her croaking, however,
to ask him the same question as she had asked his brother; and, as he
and his brother had agreed together on what they considered a clever
answer, he now gave her the same, which she received by repeating the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href="#pb398" name=
"pb398">398</a>]</span>menace she had ejaculated the first time. And
when he brought his basket to the Kaiser it also was found to be filled
with street-sweepings instead of pears! With even more of indignation
they hurried him off to prison, putting him in the next cell to his
brother.</p>
<p>Meantime the year was wearing away, and the promised tidings of good
fortune not reaching the father, he got very uneasy. The third son had
no pretension to the sharpness his brothers boasted. He was a very dull
boy, and often had to endure being laughed at by the others for his
slow parts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity it is you are so heavy and stupid!&rdquo; his
father now would often say. &ldquo;If I only dared trust you, how glad
I should be to send you to see what has befallen your
brothers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad was used to hear himself pronounced good-for-nothing, and so
he did not take much notice of these observations at first, but seeing
his father really in distress, his affectionate heart was moved, and he
one day summoned courage to say he would go and see if he could not
find his brothers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think you can keep yourself out of harm&rsquo;s
way?&rdquo; exclaimed his father, glad to find him propose to undertake
the adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do whatever you tell me,&rdquo; replied the lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you shan&rsquo;t go empty-handed, at all events,&rdquo;
said the father. And, as the pears were just ripe <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href="#pb399" name=
"pb399">399</a>]</span>again, he laid the choicest of the year&rsquo;s
stock in another Krattle, and sent him on his way.</p>
<p>The boy walked along, looking neither to right nor left, but with
his heart beating, lest he should come across the &ldquo;harm&rdquo;
out of the way of which he had promised to keep himself. All went
smoothly, however, except that he got terribly scorched by the sun, and
when he reached the fountain, he was glad to sit down to rest and
refresh himself.</p>
<p>The old wife was washing her rags in the water, and singing, as she
patted the linen, a ditty all out of tune. &ldquo;Here comes a third of
those surly dogs, I declare!&rdquo; she said to herself, as she saw him
arrive with another lot of the magnificent pears. &ldquo;I suppose
he&rsquo;ll be making game of me too&mdash;as if I didn&rsquo;t know
the scent of ripe golden pears from road-sweepings! a likely matter!
But if they enjoy making game of me, I have a splendid revenge to enjoy
upon them, so I oughtn&rsquo;t to complain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morrow, little mother!&rdquo; said the boy, in his blunt
way, ere he sat down, at the same time not omitting to doff his cap, as
he had been taught, because she happened to be old and
ugly&mdash;matters of which he had no very nice appreciation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s better mannered than the other louts, for all he
doesn&rsquo;t look so bright-faced,&rdquo; said the hag to herself; and
she stopped her discordant song to return his greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I sit down here a bit, please, good mother? <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href="#pb400" name=
"pb400">400</a>]</span>asked the boy, thinking in his simplicity the
fountain must belong to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you may, and take a draught of the cool water
too,&rdquo; replied the dame, wondrously propitiated by his
civility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what may it be with which you are so laden, my pretty
boy?&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;It ought to be a precious burden to
be worth carrying so far as you seem to have come. What have you in
your Krattle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precious are the contents, I believe you,&rdquo; replied the
simple boy; &ldquo;at least, so one would think from the store my
father sets by them. They are true golden pears, and he says there are
no finer grown in the whole kingdom; and I am taking them to the Kaiser
because he is very fond of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only ripe pears, and yet so heavy?&rdquo; returned the old
wife; &ldquo;one would say it was something heavier than pears. But
you&rsquo;ll see when you come to your journey&rsquo;s end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy assured her they were nothing but pears, and as one of his
father&rsquo;s injunctions had been not to lose time by the way, he
paid the old dame a courteous greeting and continued his journey.</p>
<p>When the servants saw another peasant boy from B&uuml;rs come to the
palace with the story that he had pears for the king, they said,
&ldquo;No, no! we have had enough of that! you may just turn round and
go back.&rdquo; But the poor simple boy was so disappointed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401" name=
"pb401">401</a>]</span>at the idea of going back to be laughed at for
not fulfilling his message, that he sank down on the door-step and
sobbed bitterly, and there he remained sobbing till the Kaiser came
out.</p>
<p>The Kaiser had his daughter with him, and when she saw the boy
sobbing, she inquired what ailed him; and learnt it was another boy
from B&uuml;rs come to insult the Kaiser with a basket of
road-sweepings, and asked if they should take him off to prison
too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I <i>have</i> got pears!&rdquo; sobbed the boy;
&ldquo;and my father says there are no finer in the empire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; we know that by heart. That&rsquo;s what the others
said!&rdquo; replied the servants, jeering; and they would have dragged
him away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t you look at my pears first, fair lady? the
pears that I have brought all this long way for the Kaiser? My father
will be so sorry!&rdquo; for he was too ignorant to feel abashed at the
presence of the princess, and he spoke to her with as much confidence
as if she had been a village maiden.</p>
<p>The princess was struck by the earnestness with which he spoke, and
decided to see the contents of his basket. The moment he heard her
consent, he walked straight up with his Krattle, quite regardless of
the whole troop of lacqueys, strong in the justice of his cause.</p>
<p>The princess removed the covering of leaves, and discovered that
what he had brought were golden <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402"
href="#pb402" name="pb402">402</a>]</span>pears indeed, for each pear,
large as it was, was of solid shining metal!</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are pears indeed worthy to set before the
Kaiser!&rdquo; she said, and presented them to her father.</p>
<p>The Kaiser was pleased to see his favourite fruit so splendidly
immortalized, and ordered the pears to be laid up in his cabinet of
curiosities; but to the boy, for his reward, he ordered that whatever
he asked should be given.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I want is to find my two brothers, who hold some great
office at court,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your brothers hold office in prison, if they are those I
suspect,&rdquo; said the Kaiser, and commanded that they should be
brought. The boys immediately ran to embrace each other; and the Kaiser
made them each recount all their adventures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see how dangerous it is to depart from the truth!&rdquo;
he said, when they had done. &ldquo;And never forget that, with all
your cleverness, you might have remained in prison to the end of your
days but for the straightforward simplicity of him you thought so
inferior to yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he ordered that the tree which brought forth such excellent
pears should be transplanted to his palace; and to the father and his
three sons he gave places among his gardeners, where they lived in
plenty and were well content. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb403"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a poor peasant, named Taland, who lived
in a poor cottage in the Walserthal, a valley of Vorarlberg. He was as
poor in wits as in fortune, so that he was continually making himself
the laughing-stock of his neighbours; yet, as he possessed a certain
sort of cunning, which fortune was pleased to favour, he got on better
in the long run than many a wiser man. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb404" href="#pb404" name="pb404">404</a>]</span></p>
<p>Plodding along steadily, and living frugally, Taland, in process of
time, laid by enough money to buy a cow; and a cow he bought without
even stopping to consider that he had no means of pasturing it.</p>
<p>The cow, however, provided for that by her own instinct; there were
plenty of good pastures in the neighbourhood, and the cow was not slow
to discover them. Wherever the grass was freshest and sweetest, thither
she wandered, and by this token Taland had no difficulty in finding her
out at milking time; and in the whole country round there was no
sleeker or better-favoured animal.</p>
<p>But the neighbours at whose expense she fed so well in course of
time grew angry; and finding remonstrance vain, they met together and
determined to kill the cow; and, that none might have to bear the blame
of killing her more than another, every one of them stuck his knife
into her. By this means, not only was poor Taland&rsquo;s cow
destroyed, but even the hide was riddled with holes, and so rendered
useless.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Taland skinned his cow, and plodded away with the hide
to the nearest tanner, as if he had not the sense to be conscious that
it was spoilt. The tanner was not at home, but his wife was able to
decide without him, that there was no business to be done with such
goods, and she sent him away with a mocking laugh, bidding <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href="#pb405" name="pb405">405</a>]</span>him
remember she dealt in hides, and not in sieves.</p>
<p>Taland, however, had come a long way, and having no money to buy
food, he begged so piteously for a morsel of refreshment, that the good
wife could not refuse, and having spread a table before him with good
cheer, went on about her business.</p>
<p>Taland, delighted with the spread, determined to do justice to it;
and as he sat and ate he saw the tanner&rsquo;s son, an urchin full of
tricks, hide himself, while his mother&rsquo;s back was turned, in an
old corn-bin which stood before the door. He went on eating and
drinking, and watching the corn-bin, and still the boy never came out,
till at last, he rightly judged, he had fallen asleep. Meantime, having
finished his meal, he turned to take leave of the tanner&rsquo;s wife;
and then, as he went away, he said, quite cursorily, &ldquo;If you have
no use for that old corn-bin yonder&mdash;it&rsquo;s just the thing I
want&mdash;you may as well give it to me, and you won&rsquo;t have sent
me away empty-handed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! you want that lumbering, rotten old corn-bin?&rdquo;
cried the tanner&rsquo;s wife; and she laughed more heartily than even
at the riddled cow-hide. &ldquo;And you would carry it all the way home
on your shoulders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The peasant nodded a stupid assent, without speaking. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406" name="pb406">406</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then take it, pray, and be welcome; for I just wanted to get
rid of the unsightly old rubbish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taland thanked her, and loaded the chest on his shoulder, but
carefully, lest he should wake the child too soon. And carefully he
continued to walk along with it till the tan-yard was left far, far out
of sight. Then he stopped short, and, setting the corn-bin down with a
jerk calculated to wake its inmate, he holloaed out,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be going to fling the old corn-bin down the
precipice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, stop! I&rsquo;m inside!&rdquo; cried the child, but
with a tone of conviction that he had only to ask, to be let out. This
was not Taland&rsquo;s game, who wanted to give him a thorough
frightening; so he shouted again, taking no heed of the child&rsquo;s
voice,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be going to fling the old corn-bin down the
precipice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! stop! I tell you; I&rsquo;m inside it!&rdquo; repeated
the boy, in a louder tone, thinking he had not made himself heard
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who be you? and what be you to me?&rdquo; replied Taland, in
a stupid tone of indifference. &ldquo;I be going to chuck the old
corn-bin down the precipice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, stop! for heaven&rsquo;s sake, stop!&rdquo; screamed the
now really affrighted child; &ldquo;stop, and spare me! Only let me
out, and mother will give you ever such a heap of gold!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407" name=
"pb407">407</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long way back to &lsquo;mother,&rsquo;&rdquo;
replied the peasant, churlishly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d much rather chuck the
old thing over, and have done with it. You&rsquo;re not worth enough to
repay the trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I am though!&rdquo; answered the boy, in a positive
tone. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing mother wouldn&rsquo;t give to save
my life, I know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would she give, d&rsquo;you think? Would she give five
hundred thalers, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, <i>that</i> she would!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a longsome way; but if you promise I shall
have five hundred thalers, I don&rsquo;t mind if I oblige
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have them, safe enough, never fear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this promise, Taland took the boy home, and made up a story of
his surprise at finding him at the bottom of the old chest, and how
hardly he had saved his life. The mother, overjoyed at the idea of her
son being restored to her under such circumstances, readily counted out
the five hundred thalers, and sent Taland home a richer man than when
his fortune consisted of a cow.</p>
<p>Elated with his good fortune, our hero determined to have a bit of
fun with his spiteful neighbours, and accordingly sat himself down in
an arbour, where there was a large round table, in front of the
Wirthshaus, and spreading his heap of gold before him, amused himself
with counting it out. Of course the sight attracted all the peasants of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href="#pb408" name=
"pb408">408</a>]</span>the place, who were just gathering for a gossip
on their way home from work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where did you get such a heap of gold from?&rdquo; asked
a dozen excited voices at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the sale of the cow-hide, to be sure,&rdquo; replied
Taland, in an inanimate voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! the cow-hide all riddled with holes?&rdquo; vociferated
his interlocutors, in a chorus of ridicule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure; that&rsquo;s just what made it so
valuable,&rdquo; persisted Taland, confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! the tanner gives more for a hide all full of holes than
for a sound one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of asking so many silly
questions?&rdquo; returned the imperturbable peasant &ldquo;Do you see
the money? and should I have got such a sum for an ordinary cow-hide?
If you can answer these two questions of mine, you can answer your own
for yourselves;&rdquo; and gathering up his gold, he walked away with a
stolid look which defied further interrogations.</p>
<p>The village wiseacres were all struck with the same idea. If riddled
cowhides fetched five hundred thalers apiece, the best way to make a
fortune was to kill all the cows in the commune, pierce their skins all
over with holes, and carry them to the tanner. Every one went home to
calculate what he would make by the venture; and the morning was all
too long coming, so eager were they to put their plan into execution.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href="#pb409" name=
"pb409">409</a>]</span></p>
<p>Taland, having now plenty of money, had nothing to do next day but
to dress himself in his feast-day clothes and play at dominoes in the
Bier-garten; but though this was a favourite enjoyment, far sweeter was
that of observing the running hither and thither of his spiteful,
mocking neighbours, slaughtering their sleek kine&mdash;the provision
of their future lives&mdash;skinning them, and destroying the very
skins out of which some small compensation might have been earned.</p>
<p>Taland hardly knew how to contain his inclination to laugh, as he
saw them caught in his trap so coarsely baited; and the good landlord,
as he saw the irrepressible giggle again and again convulse his stupid
features, thought that the gain of the five hundred thalers had fairly
turned his weak head.</p>
<p>The peasants had gone off to the tan-yard with their riddled
cow-hides, merrily shouting and boasting; and Taland sat at home,
drinking and laughing. But it was a different story by-and-by. There
was a sound like the roar of a wild beast, which stopped even
Taland&rsquo;s inclination to laugh, and made him shrink in his chair.
It was the lament of the long file of peasants returning from the
tan-yard from their bootless errand, filling the air as they went along
with yells of fury at their ruin, and imprecations and threats of
vengeance on him who had led them into the snare. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb410" href="#pb410" name="pb410">410</a>]</span></p>
<p>Taland had meant to have had his laugh over their discomfiture, but
finding them in this mood, he thought his wisest course was to keep out
of their sight, lest they should take summary vengeance on him. So he
found a corner to hide himself in; and he thus overheard their debate
on the means of punishing their deceiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s such shifts for getting out of every thing, that
one doesn&rsquo;t know where to have him,&rdquo; said the noisiest
speaker; and the rest re-echoed the sentiment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay; it&rsquo;ll never do to let him get scent of what
we&rsquo;re up to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how to avoid it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay; take him when he&rsquo;s asleep; that&rsquo;s the
way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go up the stairs and rattle at his window, and when he comes
out, knock him on the head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And every one have a go at him, as we did at his
cow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the plan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the sooner the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This very night, before we go to bed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure; we won&rsquo;t sleep tamely upon such an
affront.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; we&rsquo;ll make an end of it, that we will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s time we did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another day would be unbearable!&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb411" href="#pb411" name="pb411">411</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Another hour is bad enough; but we must keep quiet till
he&rsquo;s well asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; there&rsquo;s nothing to be done till
midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll meet again at midnight, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; we shall all be there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, then, till midnight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, till midnight; good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all spoke at once, and the whole dark plan was concocted in a
few minutes; then they dispersed to their homes with resolute
steps.</p>
<p>Taland listened to the sound with beating heart, and as soon as
silence once more prevailed, he stole stealthily homewards.</p>
<p>His wife was sitting over her spinning-wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve caught a cold wearing these holiday clothes out of
their turn,&rdquo; said Taland; &ldquo;will you do me the favour to
sleep in the window-sill, and keep that flapping shutter close, good
wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; responded the compliant spouse; and
thus disposed, they went to rest.</p>
<p>At midnight the villagers came, faithful to their appointment, in a
strong body, and mounted the stairs<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6175src"
href="#xd21e6175" name="xd21e6175src">95</a> as quietly as might be.
The foremost pushed open the shutter, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Why,
here&rsquo;s the old idiot lying ready for us, across the
window-sill!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb412" href="#pb412"
name="pb412">412</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re spared the trouble of hunting for
him,&rdquo; exclaimed the next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So here goes!&rdquo; cried all together; and they showered
their blows on the devoted body of the old wife, while Taland,
comfortably enveloped in his coverlet, once more laughed at the success
of his deceit, and the discomfiture of his foes.</p>
<p>Towards morning he rose, and taking up the dead body, placed it in a
chair, and bore it along, together with the old spinning-wheel, a good
distance down the high road; and there he left it, while he sat behind
a bush to see what would happen.</p>
<p>Presently a fine lord came along the road driving a noble
chariot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holloa, good woman! get out of the way!&rdquo; shouted the
lord, while yet at a considerable distance; for he thought the old
woman was silly, spinning in the roadway. But the corpse moved not for
his shouting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holloa! holloa, I say! you&rsquo;ll be killed! move,
can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he cried, thinking she was deaf, and
hadn&rsquo;t heard his first appeal. But still the corpse moved
not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of the way! get out of the road! can&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; at last fairly screamed the lord; for, never dreaming but
that the woman would move in time, he had not reined in his fiery
steeds&mdash;and now it was all too late! On one side went the old lady
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href="#pb413" name=
"pb413">413</a>]</span>in the chair, and on the other side the
fragments of the spinning-wheel, while the chariot dashed wildly on
between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have I done?&rdquo; said the lord, alighting from his
chariot as soon as he could stop, and looking round him in wild
despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve run over and killed my old mother!
<i>that&rsquo;s</i> what you&rsquo;ve done!&rdquo; said Taland,
emerging from his hiding-place. &ldquo;And now you must come with me
before the judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, I meant no harm,&rdquo; pleaded the good lord;
&ldquo;I called to her to get out of the way, and I couldn&rsquo;t help
it if she was deaf. But I&rsquo;ll make you what compensation you like.
What do you say to accepting my chariot full of gold, and the horses
and all, to drive home with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if you say you couldn&rsquo;t help it, I suppose you
<i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>,&rdquo; replied Taland. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
to hurt you; and since you offer fair terms, I&rsquo;m willing to
accept your chariot full of gold, and the horses to drive it home.
I&rsquo;ll square the account to your satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the lord took him home to his castle and filled up the chariot
with gold, and put the reins in his hands, and sent him home richer and
merrier than if the neighbours had never attempted his life.</p>
<p>When these same envious neighbours, however, saw him coming home in
the chariot full of gold, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href=
"#pb414" name="pb414">414</a>]</span>driving the prancing horses quite
<i>gravit&ecirc;tisch</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e6221src" href=
"#xd21e6221" name="xd21e6221src">96</a>, they knew not what to make of
it. And that, too, just as they were congratulating themselves that
they had made an end of him!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be his ghost!&rdquo; they cried. There was no other
way of accounting for the reappearance. But as he drove nearer, there
was no denying that it was his very self in flesh and blood!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you come from? where did you get all that heap of
money from? and what story are you going to palm off on us this
time?&rdquo; were questions which were showered down on him like
hail.</p>
<p>Taland knew how easily they let themselves be ensnared, and that the
real story would do as well this time as any he could make up, so he
told them exactly what had happened, and then whipped his horses into a
canter which dispersed them right and left, while he drove home as
<i>gravit&ecirc;tisch</i> as before.</p>
<p>Nor was he wrong in expecting his bait to take. With one accord the
peasants all went home and killed their wives, and set them, with their
spinningwheels before them, all along the road. Of course, however, no
lucky chance occurred such as Taland&rsquo;s&mdash;no file of noblemen
driving lordly chariots, and silly enough to mistake the dead for the
living, came by; and while Taland was rich enough to marry the best
woman in the place, they had all to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb415" href="#pb415" name="pb415">415</a>]</span>bury their wives and
live alone in their desolated homes.</p>
<p>To have been so tricked was indeed enough to raise their ire; and
the only consolation amid their gloom was to meet and concoct some plan
for taking signal and final vengeance. This was at last found. They
were to seize him by night, as before; but this time they were not to
beat him to death in the dark, but keep him bound till daylight, and
make sure of their man, then bind him in a sack and throw him over the
precipice of the Hoch Gerach.</p>
<p>As Taland was not by to overhear and provide against the
arrangement, it was carried out to the letter this time; and all tied
in a sack the struggling victim was borne along in triumph towards the
Hoch Gerach. They had already passed the village of St. Gerold, and the
fatal gorge forced through the wall of living rock by the incessant
world-old wear of rushing torrents was nearly reached. Taland,
paralyzed with fear and exhaustion, had desisted from his contortions
for very weariness.</p>
<p>The <span lang="de">H&auml;usergruppe</span><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6246src" href="#xd21e6246" name="xd21e6246src">97</a> of
Felsenau, standing like a sentinel on guard of the narrow hollow, had
yet to be passed. It was near midday, and the toil of the ascent had
been great. Not one of the party objected to take a snatch of rest and
a sip of brandy to give them courage to complete the deed in hand.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href="#pb416" name=
"pb416">416</a>]</span></p>
<p>While they sat drinking in the shade of the cottage which stood
Felsenau in lieu of a Wirthshaus, Taland was left lying on a grassy
bank in the sun. About the same time a goatherd, driving his flock into
Bludenz to be milked, came by that way, and seeing the strangely-shaped
sack with something moving inside, arrested his steps to examine into
the affair. Taland, finding some one meddling with the mouth of the
sack, holloaed out,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;List&rsquo;ee! I&rsquo;ll have nothing to do with the
princess!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What princess?&rdquo; inquired the goatherd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the princess I was to marry. B&rsquo;aint you the
king?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What king?&rdquo; again asked the goatherd, more and more
puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk while I&rsquo;m stifled in here,&rdquo;
replied Taland. &ldquo;Let me out, and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curious goatherd released the captive from the bag, and he told
his tale as follows. &ldquo;The king has got a beautiful
daughter&mdash;so beautiful that such a number of suitors come after
her she cannot decide between them all. At last the king got tired, and
said he would decide for her; and this morning he proclaimed that
whoever could bear being carried about for seven hours in this sack
should have her, be he peasant or prince. So I thought I might try my
luck at it as well as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href=
"#pb417" name="pb417">417</a>]</span>another; and those chaps you hear
talking in the little house yonder have been carrying me about for
three hours, but I can&rsquo;t stand more of it, and away I go;&rdquo;
and he looked up anxiously to see if the bait had taken; for he wanted
the other to propose to get into the sack, as, if he had walked away
and left it empty, he knew the villagers would pursue and overtake him.
Nor was he mistaken in his calculation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem so hard to bear,&rdquo; said the
goatherd, after some moments&rsquo; consideration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to try?&rdquo; inquired Taland, anxiously;
&ldquo;it won&rsquo;t be so bad for you, as, if you get in now, the men
won&rsquo;t perceive we have changed places, and you&rsquo;ll get the
benefit of three hours for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really very kind!&rdquo; responded the goatherd,
drawing the sack over him; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to thank you
enough. I&rsquo;m sure I can stand four hours easily enough, for the
sake of being reckoned a king&rsquo;s son at the end. I shan&rsquo;t
want the goats, however, when I&rsquo;m married to a princess, so pray
take them at a gift&mdash;only make fast the cords of the sack so that
the men may not perceive that it has been meddled with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taland tied up the sack exactly as it had been before, and drove
home the flock of goats.</p>
<p>He was scarcely out of sight when the men, now well rested, came
out, and having taken up the sack <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb418"
href="#pb418" name="pb418">418</a>]</span>again, carried it up the Hoch
Gerach; and just as the unhappy goatherd within fancied he was reaching
the top of some high terrace leading to the royal palace, bang, bang
from rock to rock he found himself dashed by the relentless
villagers!</p>
<p>Confident that the job was now effectually completed, they trooped
home full of rejoicing over their feat.</p>
<p>The first thing that met their eye, however, was Taland seated
before his door, just as if nothing had happened, milking the goats
which browsed around him, making a goodly show.</p>
<p>Too much awed at the sight to rush at and seize him, they once more
asked him to give explanation of his unlooked-for return, and of how he
became possessed of such a fine herd of goats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing easier!&rdquo; replied Taland,
<i>gravit&ecirc;tisch</i>. &ldquo;Where shall I begin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From where you were thrown over the mountain-side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; pursued Taland. &ldquo;Well, then, as you
may suppose, I struggled hard to get out of the sack, but it was too
tough, and I could do nothing with it at first; but, by-and-by, from
knocking against the jutting rocks again and again, it got a rent, and
this rent I was able to tear open wide, so that by the time I got to
the bottom there was a big hole, big enough to get out by. And where do
you think I found myself when I got out? In the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419" name=
"pb419">419</a>]</span>enchanted regions of the underground world,
where the sky is tenfold as blue as it is here, and the meadows tenfold
as green! It was so beautiful to look at that I gladly wandered on a
little space. Presently I found a way that led up home again; but I had
no mind to come away from the beautiful country till I saw, climbing
the rocks by the side of the path, numbers of goats, much finer than
any goats we ever see in these parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they are! so they are!&rdquo; chimed in the gullible
multitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I thought it would be fine to bring a flock of such fine
goats home&mdash;and, after all, it was easy to go back again when I
wanted to see that deep blue sky and those rich pastures again; so home
I came. Here am I, and here are the goats; and if you don&rsquo;t
believe I got them there, you can go and fetch some thence and compare
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But shall we really find such goats if we go?&rdquo; eagerly
inquired the credulous villagers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure you will&mdash;and sheep, and oxen, and cows too,
without number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cows too! Oh, let&rsquo;s come and supply ourselves, and make
good our losses! But first show the way you came up by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a long, steep, weary way, and would take you
two days to get down! Much the nearest way is to jump down the side of
the Hoch Gerach.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb420" href=
"#pb420" name="pb420">420</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But are you sure we shan&rsquo;t hurt ourselves? Didn&rsquo;t
you get hurt at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit. Feel me; I&rsquo;m quite sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, you couldn&rsquo;t hurt falling on to such soft,
beautiful meadows!&rdquo; they replied; and off they set, only eager
which should reach the Hoch Gerach first, and which should be the first
to make the bold spring, and which should have the first pick and
choice of the fair flocks and herds in the enchanted world
underground!</p>
<p>Slap! bang! plump! they all went over the side of the Hoch Gerach,
one after the other, never to return! And Taland thus alone remained to
inherit the houses and goods of the whole village, all for
himself&mdash;and, from being the poorest of all, became possessed of
the riches of all.</p>

German legends are inclined to extol the heroism of Dietrich von Bern,
better known to us as Theodoric, King of the Visigoths, who, after his
conquests in Italy, built a palace at Verona, and made it his seat of
government; but the traditions of Verona ascribe his great strength and
success, both as a hunter and warrior, to a compact with the Evil One.
His connexion with the Arians, his opposition towards the Popes, and
his violent destruction of the churches of Verona, were sufficient to
convince the popular mind at his date that his strength was not from
above. Procopius relates that his remorse for the death of Symmachus
haunted him so, that one day when the head of a great fish was served
at table, it appeared to him as the head of his murdered relative, and
he became so horrified that he was never able to eat any thing
afterwards. The Veronese tradition is, that by his pact with the devil,
evil spirits served him in the form of dogs, horses, and huntsmen,
until the time came that they drove him forth into their own abode
(<i lang="it">Mattei Verona Illustrata</i>). In the church of St. Zeno
at Verona this legend may be seen sculptured in bas-relief over the
door. In the mythology of some parts of Germany he is identified, or
confounded, with the Wild Huntsman (B&ouml;rner, <i lang="de">Sagen aus
dem Orlagau</i>, pp. 213<span class="corr" id="xd21e1050" title=
"Source: .">,</span> 216<span class="corr" id="xd21e1053" title=
"Source: .">,</span> 236). In the <i lang="de">Heldenbuch</i> he is
called the son of an evil spirit. He is there distinguished by a fiery
breath, with which he overcomes dwarfs and giants; but he is said to be
ultimately carried off into the wilds by a demon-horse, upon which he
has every day to fight with two terrible dragons until the Judgment
Day. Nork cites a passage from Luther&rsquo;s works, in which he speaks
of him (cursorily) as the incarnation of evil, showing how he was
regarded in Germany at his day (&ldquo;It is as if I should undertake
to make Christ out of Dietrich von Bern&rdquo;&mdash;<i lang="de">Als
wenn ich aus Dietrich von Bern Christum machen wollte</i>).</p>

consider them as amenable to Christian precepts. The ancient church of
the village of St. Peter, near the Castle of Tirol, is said by popular
tradition to have been built by them, and under peculiar difficulties;
for while they were at work, a giant who lived in Schloss Tirol used to
come every night and destroy what they had done in the day, till at
last they agreed to assemble in great force, and complete the whole
church in one day, which they did; and then, being a complete work
offered to the service of God, the giant had no more power over it.</p>

difficult paths&mdash;particularly the Zillerthal, on which the scene

battle. The victor is afterwards marched through the commune to the
sound of bells and music, and decked with garlands of flowers.</p>

"xd21e4095" href="#xd21e4095src" name="xd21e4095">72</a></span> The
stories of our Lord&rsquo;s life on earth, treated with perfect
idealism, sketching His character as He was pleased to manifest it, or
His miraculous acts, pervade the popular mythology of all Catholic
peoples. I have given one from Spain, by the title of &ldquo;Where One
can Dine, Two can Dine,&rdquo; in &ldquo;Patra&ntilde;as,&rdquo; of the
same character as this Tirolese one; and perhaps it is not amiss to
repeat the observation I felt called to make upon it,&mdash;that it
would be the greatest mistake to imagine that anything like irreverence
was intended in such stories. They are the simple utterances of peoples
who realized so utterly and so devoutly the facts recorded in the
Gospels that the circumstances of time and place ceased to occupy them
at all, and who were wont to make the study of our Lord&rsquo;s example
their rule of conduct so habitually, that to imagine Him sharing the
accidents of their own daily life came more natural to them than to
think of Him in the far-off East. These stories were probably either
adapted from the personal traditions which the first evangelists may
well be thought to have brought with them unwritten, or invented by
themselves, in all good faith, as allegories, by means of which to
inculcate by them upon their children the application of His maxims to
their own daily acts. They demand, therefore, to be read in this spirit
for the sake of the pious intention in which they are conceived, rather
than criticised for their rude simplicity or their anachronisms.</p>

preference to those stories which have a moral point to recommend them;
my readers will not, perhaps, take it amiss, however, if I present them
with this specimen of a class in which this is wanting, and which aims
only at amusement. It is, moreover, interesting from the strong
evidence it bears of extremely remote origin; for the light way in
which putting people to death, deception, and selfishness are spoken of
prove it has a pre-Christian source, while the unimportant accessories
show how details get modified by transmission.</p>
